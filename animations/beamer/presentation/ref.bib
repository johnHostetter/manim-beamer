	abstract = {This work presents a multi-objective evolutionary linguistic fuzzy system that addresses regression problems, especially those that are dimensional and scalable. A multi-objective knowledge base learning (MOKBL) is developed in the first stage of this model. MOKBL learns the most relevant and least redundant features by considering the desirability of the components of the fuzzy system. At the same time as feature selection, MOKBL slightly tunes the membership functions to provide greater initial adaptation of the fuzzy rule-based system components. In the second stage, multi-objective modifications (MOMs) are organized to modify the generated fuzzy system and to perform post-processing tasks. MOMs more finely tune the membership functions and prune additional rules. The newly proposed rule pruning method can eliminate weak rules from the rule base using the concepts of support and confidence. The membership functions tuning process is accomplished using the tasks of core displacement and width alteration of the symmetric functions. MOKBL+MOMs and its stages were validated using 28 real-world datasets and compared with two state-of-the-art regression solutions through non-parametric statistical tests. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of MOKBL+MOMs in terms of interpretability (complexity), accuracy, and time.},

abstract = {Process modeling with limited experimental data is always a difficult task. It becomes even more difficult if the process is highly nonlinear and is characterized by multiple inputs and outputs. Under these circumstances, fuzzy logic may show its capabilities for model development. In this paper, an efficient fuzzy modeling methodology is introduced. The resulting fuzzy model consists of a number of fuzzy implications, each of which is of an IF–THEN form. The IF part consists of a set of logically related antecedents, while the THEN part contains a consequent expressed as a set of linear models. To ensure model simplicity and to accelerate the modeling process, an effective model-development route has been developed. To guarantee the model’s reliability, a t-test-based non-linearity analysis is proposed when each fuzzy implication is developed. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated by modeling two nonlinear industrial processes.}

abstract = {Federated adversary domain adaptation is a unique distributed minimax training task due to the heterogeneous data among different local clients, where each client only sees a subset of the data that merely belongs to either the source or target domain. Despite the extensive research in distributed minimax optimization, existing communication efficient solvers that exploit multiple steps of the local update are still not able to generate satisfactory solutions for federated adversarial domain adaptation because of the gradient divergence issue among clients. To tackle this problem, we propose a distributed minimax optimizer, referred to as FedMM, by introducing dual variables to bridge the gradient gap among clients. This algorithm is effective even in the extreme case where each client has different label classes and some clients only have unlabeled data. We prove that FedMM admits benign convergence to a stationary point under domain-shifted unlabeled data. On a variety of benchmark datasets, extensive experiments show that FedMM consistently achieves both better communication savings and significant accuracy improvements over existing federated optimizers based on the stochastic gradient descent ascent (SGDA) algorithm. When training from scratch, for example, it outperforms other SGDA based federated average methods by around 20\% in accuracy over the same communication rounds; and it consistently outperforms when training from pre-trained models.},

Here, we introduce Enhanced Integrated Gradients (EIG), a method to identify significant features associated with a specific prediction task. Using RNA splicing prediction as well as digit classification as case studies, we demonstrate that EIG improves upon the original Integrated Gradients method and produces sets of informative features. We then apply EIG to identify A1CF as a key regulator of liver-specific alternative splicing, supporting this finding with subsequent analysis of relevant A1CF functional (RNA-seq) and binding data (PAR-CLIP).},

The implications of these measures for the experimental study of small groups is examined.}

With the development of deep learning technology, autoencoder has attracted the attention of many scholars. Researchers have proposed several improved versions of autoencoder based on different application fields. First, this paper explains the principle of a conventional autoencoder and investigates the primary development process of an autoencoder. Second, We proposed a taxonomy of autoencoders according to their structures and principles. The related autoencoder models are comprehensively analyzed and discussed. This paper introduces the application progress of autoencoders in different fields, such as image classification and natural language processing, etc. Finally, the shortcomings of the current autoencoder algorithm are summarized, and prospected for its future development directions are addressed.}

abstract = {Imitation learning techniques aim to mimic human behavior in a given task. An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions.},

abstract = {When clustering a dataset, the right number k of clusters to use is often not obvious, and choosing k automatically is a hard algorithmic problem. In this paper we present an improved algorithm for learning k while clustering. The G-means algorithm is based on a statistical test for the hypothesis that a subset of data follows a Gaussian distribution. G-means runs k-means with increasing k in a hierarchical fashion until the test accepts the hypothesis that the data assigned to each k-means center are Gaussian. Two key advantages are that the hypothesis test does not limit the covariance of the data and does not compute a full covariance matrix. Additionally, G-means only requires one intuitive parameter, the standard statistical significance level α. We present results from experiments showing that the algorithm works well, and better than a recent method based on the BIC penalty for model complexity. In these experiments, we show that the BIC is ineffective as a scoring function, since it does not penalize strongly enough the model's complexity.},

Such issues include: algorithmic transparency, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, unfairness, bias and discrimination, lack of contestability, legal personhood issues, intellectual property issues, adverse effects on workers, privacy and data protection issues, liability for damage and lack of accountability. The article uses the frame of ‘vulnerability’ to consolidate the understanding of critical areas of concern and guide risk and impact mitigation efforts to protect human well-being. While recognising the good work carried out in the AI law space, and acknowledging this area needs constant evaluation and agility in approach, this article advances the discussion, which is important given the gravity of the impacts of AI technologies, particularly on vulnerable individuals and groups, and their human rights.}

abstract={Relational reinforcement learning is presented, a learning technique that combines reinforcement learning with relational learning or inductive logic programming. Due to the use of a more expressive representation language to represent states, actions and Q-functions, relational reinforcement learning can be potentially applied to a new range of learning tasks. One such task that we investigate is planning in the blocks world, where it is assumed that the effects of the actions are unknown to the agent and the agent has to learn a policy. Within this simple domain we show that relational reinforcement learning solves some existing problems with reinforcement learning. In particular, relational reinforcement learning allows us to employ structural representations, to abstract from specific goals pursued and to exploit the results of previous learning phases when addressing new (more complex) situations.},

abstract = {Four experiments investigated conceptual categorization in 7- to 11-month-old infants. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that 9-and 11-month-olds differentiated the global domains of animals and vehicles. Within the animal domain no subcategorization was found: the infants did not differentiate dogs from fish or from rabbits. Within the vehicle domain infants differentiated cars from both airplanes and motorcycles. Experiment 3 showed similar, although weaker, categorization for 7-month-olds. Experiment 4 showed that categorization of animals and vehicles was unaffected by degree of between-category similarity. Birds and airplanes were treated as different even though the exemplars from both categories had similar shapes, including outstretched wings, and were of the same texture. These data, showing global differentiation of animals and vehicles, with lack of differentiation of “basic-level” categories within the animal domain, contrast with data from studies designed to assess perceptual categorization. Even younger infants differentiate various animal subcategories perceptually. However, the results presented here suggest that infants may not respond to such perceptual differences as being conceptually relevant.}

abstract = {The nature of the conceptual categories that children have developed in the second year was studied in a series of experiments using an object-manipulation task. In the first two experiments, it was shown that by 18 months children have developed global conceptual categories of animals and vehicles without yet clearly differentiating basic-level categories within these domains. The basic-level categories were tested by using a series of contrasts: a low degree of contrast was provided by presenting the children with dogs versus horses and with cars versus trucks. A moderate degree of contrast consisted of dogs versus rabbits and cars versus motorcycles. A high degree of contrast consisted of dogs versus fish (or birds) and cars versus airplanes. A domain-level contrast of animals versus vehicles was included as well. From 18 to 30 months the children tended to respond categorically only on the global domain-level contrast and on the high-contrast basic-level distinctions. Not until 30 months did the children consistently differentiate the low and moderate basic-level contrasts. Experiment 3 replicated the finding of global animal and vehicle categories, using the widest possible range of exemplars. Experiment 4 extended the study of global categorization to the domains of plants, furniture, kitchen utensils, tools, and musical instruments. Global categorization was found for plants, furniture, and kitchen utensils, but not for tools and musical instruments. Experiment 5 found little evidence for basic-level categorization of plants, and only suggestive evidence for basic-level categorization in the domains of furniture and utensils. The data demonstrate the presence of a number of global conceptual categories from an early age, and suggest that at least in some domains (animals, vehicles, and plants) such categories develop before true basic-level distinctions are made.}

abstract = {A common assumption in the developmental literature is that the earliest kind of conceptual categories to be formed are basic-level categories. A corollary assumption is that superordinate categories are formed after, and out of, previously acquired basic-level categories. Two experiments using an object-manipulation task explored these assumptions by studying response to a variety of categories in children aged from 12 to 20 months. The first experiment examined responses to basic-level categories (dogs vs. cars),superordinate categories (animals vs. vehicles), and contextual categories (kitchen things vs. bathroom things). At all ages tested, the children performed best on the basic-level categories but, even at 12 months of age, some children were responsive to the superordinate and contextual categories. By 20 months of age, approximately half of the children showed such sensitivity. The second experiment showed that 16- and 20-month-olds differentiated basic-level categories only when the categorical contrasts were taken from different superordinate classes (e.g., dogs vs. cars) and not when the categories were drawn from the same superordinate class (e.g., dogs vs. horses). The data suggest that basic-levels categories are not the first kind of conceptual categories to be formed. Instead, it appears that children may form more global categories, with basic-level differentiation occurring later.}

abstract = {Imitation of events was used to explore the inductive generalizations that 14-month-olds have made about animals, vehicles, and household artifacts. In Experiment 1 infants generalized domain-specific properties such as drinking to animals but not to vehicles, whereas they generalized domain-neutral properties such as going into a building to exemplars from both domains. The next four experiments showed that infants tend to interpret animal events very broadly, for example, construing a dog merely as a land animal rather than as a differentiated kind in its own right. Infants were somewhat more selective in their construals of vehicles. Experiment 6 showed that 14-month-olds also generalize “basic-level properties” very broadly. For example, they chose a pan to demonstrate drinking almost as often as a cup and fed a bone to a bird as often as to a dog. By 20 months, their selections narrowed appropriately for artifacts, but were still overgeneralized for natural kinds. The experiments indicate that infants tend to generalize their early experiences broadly across domains, often across exemplars that have a variety of different surface characteristics. The data suggest that it is the conceptual meaning of objects, rather than their physical features, that controls early associative learning.}

 abstract = {By decision-making in a fuzzy environment is meant a decision process in which the goals and/or the constraints, but not necessarily the system under control, are fuzzy in nature. This means that the goals and/or the constraints constitute classes of alternatives whose boundaries are not sharply defined. An example of a fuzzy constraint is: "The cost of A should not be substantially higher than α," where α is a specified constant. Similarly, an example of a fuzzy goal is: "x should be in the vicinity of x0," where x0 is a constant. The italicized words are the sources of fuzziness in these examples. Fuzzy goals and fuzzy constraints can be defined precisely as fuzzy sets in the space of alternatives. A fuzzy decision, then, may be viewed as an intersection of the given goals and constraints. A maximizing decision is defined as a point in the space of alternatives at which the membership function of a fuzzy decision attains its maximum value. The use of these concepts is illustrated by examples involving multistage decision processes in which the system under control is either deterministic or stochastic. By using dynamic programming, the determination of a maximizing decision is reduced to the solution of a system of functional equations. A reverse-flow technique is described for the solution of a functional equation arising in connection with a decision process in which the termination time is defined implicitly by the condition that the process stops when the system under control enters a specified set of states in its state space.},

	abstract = {A major limitation of fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy systems is their failure to deal with high-dimensional datasets. This happens primarily due to the use of T-norm, particularly, product or minimum (or a softer version of it). Thus, there are hardly any work dealing with datasets having features more than hundred or so. Here, we propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that can handle datasets with even more than 7000 features! In this context, we propose an adaptive softmin (Ada-softmin) which effectively overcomes the drawbacks of “numeric underflow” and “fake minimum” that arise for existing fuzzy systems while dealing with high-dimensional problems. We call it an adaptive Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (AdaTSK) fuzzy system. We then equip the AdaTSK system to perform feature selection and rule extraction in an integrated manner. In this context, a novel gate function is introduced and embedded only in the consequent parts, which can determine the useful features and rules, in two successive phases of learning. Unlike conventional fuzzy rule bases, we design an enhanced fuzzy rule base, which maintains adequate rules but does not grow the number of rules exponentially with features that typically happens for fuzzy neural networks. The integrated feature selection and rule extraction AdaTSK (FSRE-AdaTSK) system consists of three sequential phases: 1) feature selection; 2) rule extraction; and 3) fine tuning. The effectiveness of the FSRE-AdaTSK is demonstrated on 19 datasets of which five are in more than 2000 dimension including two with more than 7000 features. This may be the first attempt to develop fuzzy rule-based classifiers that can directly deal with more than 7000 features without requiring separate selection of features or any other dimensionality reduction method.},

I hope to resolve these paradoxes by identifying which aspects of fuzzy logic render it useful in practice, and which aspects are inessential.

	abstract = {Neural machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks (DNN), have achieved remarkable success in a number of complex data processing tasks. These methods have arguably had their strongest impact on tasks such as image and audio processing - data processing domains in which humans have long held clear advantages over conventional algorithms. In contrast to biological neural systems, which are capable of learning continuously, deep artificial networks have a limited ability for incorporating new information in an already trained network. As a result, methods for continuous learning are potentially highly impactful in enabling the application of deep networks to dynamic data sets. Here, inspired by the process of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, we explore the potential for adding new neurons to deep layers of artificial neural networks in order to facilitate their acquisition of novel information while preserving previously trained data representations. Our results on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and the NIST SD 19 dataset, which includes lower and upper case letters and digits, demonstrate that neurogenesis is well suited for addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma that has long challenged adaptive machine learning algorithms.},

The main purpose is to accelerate the training of a significantly larger neural net. During real-world workflows, one often trains very many different neural networks during the experimentation and design process. This is a wasteful process in which each new model is trained from scratch. Our Net2Net technique accelerates the experimentation process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a previous network to each new deeper or wider network. Our techniques are based on the concept of function-preserving transformations between neural network specifications. This differs from previous approaches to pre-training that altered the function represented by a neural net when adding layers to it. Using our knowledge transfer mechanism to add depth to Inception modules, we demonstrate a new state of the art accuracy rating on the ImageNet dataset.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Fuzzy c-means clustering is widely used to identify cluster structures in high-dimensional datasets, such as those obtained in DNA microarray and quantitative proteomics experiments. One of its main limitations is the lack of a computationally fast method to set optimal values of algorithm parameters. Wrong parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of purely random fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data. The optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering does not yield any results for a purely random dataset but which detects cluster formation with maximum resolution on the edge of randomness.Results: Estimation of the optimal parameter values is achieved by evaluation of the results of the clustering procedure applied to randomized datasets. In this case, the optimal value of the fuzzifier follows common rules that depend only on the main properties of the dataset. Taking the dimension of the set and the number of objects as input values instead of evaluating the entire dataset allows us to propose a functional relationship determining the fuzzifier directly. This result speaks strongly against using a predefined fuzzifier as typically done in many previous studies. Validation indices are generally used for the estimation of the optimal number of clusters. A comparison shows that the minimum distance between the centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or better than those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.Contact:  veits@bmb.sdu.dkSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

It is inspired by the psychological notion of Flow that describes the optimal mental state experienced by an individual when they are fully immersed in a task and find it intrinsically rewarding to engage with. The proposed model presents an algorithm to describe the Flow experience such that agents can be trained through finer distinctions to the challenges across training time to maintain them in the Flow zone. In contrast to the traditional and incremental learning approaches that suffer from limitations associated with overfitting, the Flow-based model drives agent behaviours not simply through external goals but also through intrinsic curiosity to improve their skills and thus the performance levels. Experimental evaluations are conducted across two simulation environments on a maze navigation task and a reward collection task with comparisons against a generic reinforcement learning model and an incremental reinforcement learning model. The results reveal that these two models are prone to overfit under different design decisions and loose the ability to perform in dynamic variations of the tasks in varying degrees. Conversely, the proposed Flow-based model is capable of achieving near optimal solutions with random environmental factors, appropriately utilising the previously learned knowledge to identify robust solutions to complex problems.},

	abstract = {A new biologically plausible model of visual selective attention is developed based on synaptically coupled Hodgkin–Huxley neurons. The model is designed according to a two-layer architecture of excitatory and inhibitory connections which comprises two central neurons and a population of peripheral neurons. Two types of inhibition from the central neurons are present: fixed inhibition which is responsible for the formation of the attention focus, and short-term plastic inhibition which is responsible for the shift of attention. The regimes of synchronous dynamics associated with the development of the attentional focus are studied. In particular, the regime of partial synchronization between spiking activity of the central and peripheral neurons is interpreted as object selection to the focus of attention. It is shown that peripheral neurons with higher firing rates are selected preferentially by the attention system. The model correctly reproduces some observations concerning the mechanisms of attentional control, such as the coherence of spikes in the population of neurons included in the focus of attention, and the inhibition of neurons outside the focus of attention. Sequential selection of stimuli simultaneously present in the visual scene is demonstrated by the model in the frequency domain in both a formal example and a real image.},

	abstract = {Characterization of neuronal death and neurogenesis in the adult brain of birds, humans, and other mammals raises the possibility that neuronal turnover represents a special form of neuroplasticity associated with stress responses, cognition, and the pathophysiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Multilayer neural network models capable of learning alphabetic character representations via incremental synaptic connection strength changes were used to assess additional learning and memory effects incurred by simulation of coordinated apoptotic and neurogenic events in the middle layer. Using a consistent incremental learning capability across all neurons and experimental conditions, increasing the number of middle layer neurons undergoing turnover increased network learning capacity for new information, and increased forgetting of old information. Simulations also showed that specific patterns of neural turnover based on individual neuronal connection characteristics, or the temporal-spatial pattern of neurons chosen for turnover during new learning impacts new learning performance. These simulations predict that apoptotic and neurogenic events could act together to produce specific learning and memory effects beyond those provided by ongoing mechanisms of connection plasticity in neuronal populations. Regulation of rates as well as patterns of neuronal turnover may serve an important function in tuning the informatic properties of plastic networks according to novel informational demands. Analogous regulation in the hippocampus may provide for adaptive cognitive and emotional responses to novel and stressful contexts, or operate suboptimally as a basis for psychiatric disorders. The implications of these elementary simulations for future biological and neural modeling research on apoptosis and neurogenesis are discussed.},

	abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [Larochelle et al., 2007] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P (y{\textbar}x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy controllers are efficient and interpretable system controllers for continuous state and action spaces. To date, such controllers have been constructed manually or trained automatically either using expert-generated problem-specific cost functions or incorporating detailed knowledge about the optimal control strategy. Both requirements for automatic training processes are not found in most real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems. In such applications, online learning is often prohibited for safety reasons because it requires exploration of the problem’s dynamics during policy training. We introduce a fuzzy particle swarm reinforcement learning (FPSRL) approach that can construct fuzzy RL policies solely by training parameters on world models that simulate real system dynamics. These world models are created by employing an autonomous machine learning technique that uses previously generated transition samples of a real system. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first to relate self-organizing fuzzy controllers to model-based batch RL. FPSRL is intended to solve problems in domains where online learning is prohibited, system dynamics are relatively easy to model from previously generated default policy transition samples, and it is expected that a relatively easily interpretable control policy exists. The efficiency of the proposed approach with problems from such domains is demonstrated using three standard RL benchmarks, i.e., mountain car, cart-pole balancing, and cart-pole swing-up. Our experimental results demonstrate high-performing, interpretable fuzzy policies.},

The innovations include two new ways of exploiting cached sufficient statistics and a new very efficient test that in one K-means sweep selects the most promising subset of classes for refinement. This gives rise to a fast, statistically founded algorithm that outputs both the number of classes and their parameters. Experiments show this technique reveals the true number of classes in the underlying distribution, and that it is much faster than repeatedly using accelerated K-means for different values of K.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy rule-based models have been extensively used in regression problems. Besides high accuracy, one of the most appreciated characteristics of these models is their interpretability, which is generally measured in terms of complexity. Complexity is affected by the number of features used for generating the model: the lower the number of features, the lower the complexity. Feature selection can therefore considerably contribute not only to speed up the learning process, but also to improve the interpretability of the final model. Nevertheless, a very few methods for selecting features before learning regression models have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we focus on these methods, which perform feature selection as pre-processing step. In particular, we have adapted two state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms, namely NMIFS and CFS, originally proposed for classification, to deal with regression. Further, we have proposed FMIFS, a novel forward sequential feature selection approach, based on the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion, which can manage directly fuzzy partitions. The relevance and the redundancy of a feature are measured in terms of, respectively, the fuzzy mutual information between the feature and the output variable, and the average fuzzy mutual information between the feature and the just selected features. The stopping criterion for the sequential selection is based on the average values of relevance and redundancy of the just selected features. We have performed two experiments on twenty regression datasets. In the first experiment, we aimed to show the effectiveness of feature selection in fuzzy rule-based regression model generation by comparing the mean square errors achieved by the fuzzy rule-based models generated using all the features, and the features selected by FMIFS, NMIFS and CFS. In order to avoid possible biases related to the specific algorithm, we adopted the well-known Wang and Mendel algorithm for generating the fuzzy rule-based models. We present that the mean square errors obtained by models generated by using the features selected by FMIFS are on average similar to the values achieved by using all the features and lower than the ones obtained by employing the subset of features selected by NMIFS and CFS. In the second experiment, we intended to evaluate how feature selection can reduce the convergence time of the evolutionary fuzzy systems, which are probably the most effective fuzzy techniques for tackling regression problems. By using a state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary fuzzy system based on rule learning and membership function tuning, we show that the number of evaluations can be considerably reduced when pre-processing the dataset by feature selection.},

One way to address this problem is by determining the used variables, the linguistic partitioning and the rule set together, in order to only evolve very simple, but still accurate models. However, evolving these components together is a difficult task, which involves a complex search space. In this study, we propose an effective multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that, based on embedded genetic database (DB) learning (involved variables, granularities, and slight fuzzy-partition displacements), allows the fast learning of simple and quite-accurate linguistic models. Some efficient mechanisms have been designed to ensure a very fast, but not premature, convergence in problems with a high number of variables. Further, since additional problems could arise for datasets with a large number of instances, we also propose a general mechanism for the estimation of the model error when using evolutionary algorithms, by only considering a reduced subset of the examples. By doing so, we can also apply a fast postprocessing stage for further refining the learned solutions. We tested our approach on 17 real-world datasets with different numbers of variables and instances. Three well-known methods based on embedded genetic DB learning have been executed as references. We compared the different approaches by applying nonparametric statistical tests for multiple comparisons. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method not only in terms of scalability but in terms of the simplicity and generalizability of the obtained models as well.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy Rule based regression, classification and control have found great use in modern applications due to its simplicity, flexibility and capability. A key issue in all such methods is the computation time. Computational complexity of training and testing is linearly dependent on the size of fuzzy rule base and the respective fuzzy rule space is exponentially dependent on data dimensionality. Sparse Auto-Encoders (SAs) have become popular in giving compact feature representations for image, audio and speech data and have helped in giving state of the art pattern recognition performances in most of the domains. These feature representation are learnt in an unsupervised fashion and are found to give higher order building blocks with which the data is seemingly made of. This paper proposes a method where SAs are used for getting compact feature representation of input data and if needed with reduced dimensionality. The regular fuzzy rule based models are then learnt from data in the new feature space. The method was tested for Regression and Classification problems, giving impressive results in both. The method with Regression problem gave comparable performance with almost half the number of rules and with Classification problem it gave improvement in classification accuracy by 2.67\% while reducing the size of fuzzy rule base by 11.25 times and 7.5 times by number.},

We first present a step-by-step design approach to construct the DL-FC which is composed of the encoder layer of β-VAE and a Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) followed by a softmax layer. The β-VAE is trained so that the semantic information of the high dimensional data is captured. The latent space of the β-VAE is clustered to extract FSs. The FSs are then used to define antecedents of the FLS that is trained with DL methods. We present results conducted on the MNIST dataset and showed that DL-FC is quite competitive with its deep neural network counterpart. We then try to provide an interpretation to the antecedents of FLS by examining the FSs, the latent traversals and heat-maps of each latent dimension. The results show that the antecedents of FLS can be defined with linguistic interpretations. Thus, for the first time in the literature, we showed that linguistic interpretations can be defined for the latent space of β-VAE with FSs.},

The initial rule set of the system is empty, and all the fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules are generated by a self-organized fuzzy partition algorithm. By adopting an improved box plot data standardization method, the processed data can more accurately represent the distribution characteristics of the input data, which improve the accuracy and the rationality. A fuzzy autoencoder is used to train the HFS layer by layer, which can not only ensure the effectiveness of the fuzzy system's hidden layer variables but also provide interpretability. Compared with the traditional fuzzy logic system, the HFS reduces the total number of rules and the complexity. The proposed HFS is tested on three different regression datasets. The experimental results illustrate that the hierarchical self-organized fuzzy system still performs better in terms of regression accuracy indicators than the self-organized fuzzy system.},

	abstract = {This work presents a multi-objective evolutionary linguistic fuzzy system that addresses regression problems, especially those that are dimensional and scalable. A multi-objective knowledge base learning (MOKBL) is developed in the first stage of this model. MOKBL learns the most relevant and least redundant features by considering the desirability of the components of the fuzzy system. At the same time as feature selection, MOKBL slightly tunes the membership functions to provide greater initial adaptation of the fuzzy rule-based system components. In the second stage, multi-objective modifications (MOMs) are organized to modify the generated fuzzy system and to perform post-processing tasks. MOMs more finely tune the membership functions and prune additional rules. The newly proposed rule pruning method can eliminate weak rules from the rule base using the concepts of support and confidence. The membership functions tuning process is accomplished using the tasks of core displacement and width alteration of the symmetric functions. MOKBL+MOMs and its stages were validated using 28 real-world datasets and compared with two state-of-the-art regression solutions through non-parametric statistical tests. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of MOKBL+MOMs in terms of interpretability (complexity), accuracy, and time.},

Four classes of simulation illustrated fuzzy ARTMAP performance in relation to benchmark backpropagation and generic algorithm systems. These simulations include finding points inside versus outside a circle, learning to tell two spirals apart, incremental approximation of a piecewise-continuous function, and a letter recognition database.

	abstract = {Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},

However, sample efficiency remains a key challenge, with prominent methods requiring millions (or even billions) of environment steps to train. Recently, there has been significant progress in sample efficient image-based RL algorithms; however, consistent human-level performance on the Atari game benchmark remains an elusive goal. We propose a sample efficient model-based visual RL algorithm built on MuZero, which we name EfficientZero. Our method achieves 194.3\% mean human performance and 109.0\% median performance on the Atari 100k benchmark with only two hours of real-time game experience and outperforms the state SAC in some tasks on the DMControl 100k benchmark. This is the first time an algorithm achieves super-human performance on Atari games with such little data. EfficientZero's performance is also close to DQN's performance at 200 million frames while we consume 500 times less data. EfficientZero's low sample complexity and high performance can bring RL closer to real-world applicability. We implement our algorithm in an easy-to-understand manner and it is available at https://github.com/YeWR/EfficientZero. We hope it will accelerate the research of MCTS-based RL algorithms in the wider community.},

	doi = {10.1109/91.493904},
	abstract = {As its name suggests, computing with words (CW) is a methodology in which words are used in place of numbers for computing and reasoning. The point of this note is that fuzzy logic plays a pivotal role in CW and vice-versa. Thus, as an approximation, fuzzy logic may be equated to CW. There are two major imperatives for computing with words. First, computing with words is a necessity when the available information is too imprecise to justify the use of numbers, and second, when there is a tolerance for imprecision which can be exploited to achieve tractability, robustness, low solution cost, and better rapport with reality. Exploitation of the tolerance for imprecision is an issue of central importance in CW. In CW, a word is viewed as a label of a granule; that is, a fuzzy set of points drawn together by similarity, with the fuzzy set playing the role of a fuzzy constraint on a variable. The premises are assumed to be expressed as propositions in a natural language. In coming years, computing with words is likely to evolve into a basic methodology in its own right with wide-ranging ramifications on both basic and applied levels.},

Such an elevation is achieved by granulating the data space into a concept space. Each granule represents certain primitive concept, and the granulation as a whole represents a knowledge. In this paper, such an intuitive idea is formalized into a mathematical theory: Zadeh’s informal words are taken literally as a formal definition of granulation. Such a mathematical notion is a mild generalization of the “old” notion of crisp/fuzzy neighborhood systems of (pre-)topological spaces. A crisp/fuzzy neighborhood is a granule and is assigned a meaningful name to represent certain primitive concept or to summarize the information content. The set of all linear combinations of these names, called formal words, mathematically forms a vector space over real numbers. Each vector is intuitively an advanced concept represented by some “weighted averaged” of primitive concepts. In terms of these concepts, the universe can be represented by a formal word table; this is one form of Zadeh’s veristic constraints. Such a representation is useful; fuzzy logic designs can be formulated as series of table transformations. So table processing techniques of rough set theory may be used to simplify these tables and their transformations. Therefore the complexity of large scaled fuzzy systems may be reduced; details will be reported in future papers.},

This article describes a well-defined and adaptable method for discovering innovative cases that inform best practices or positive/negative deviant research.Methods:As part of a national study of innovation in primary care settings, we developed a three-step method for identifying exemplar practices and applied that method to finding a sample of relevant innovators for in-depth case studies from which to draw transportable lessons about improving primary care practice.Results:Relevant, information-rich cases are uncovered using cycles of identification, sampling, and assessment. This cycle is repeated at each step of the defined three-step method. Step 1, a scan of the published literature, assesses both the state-of-the-art and the baseline characteristics of relevant cases; Step 2, a scan of practice settings, draws upon the expert knowledge of key informants to identify additional potentially relevant cases; and Step 3, sample refinement, evaluates potential cases for eligibility, purposeful diversity, and information-rich expressions of defined key domains. Using this three-step method, we identified a national cohort of primary care practice innovators. We found the method to be feasible, practical, and highly successful at identifying information-rich practices from which to draw transportable lessons about practice innovation.Conclusions:The three-step method outlines an effective sampling strategy for identifying innovation exemplars and information-rich cases that exceed measures of central tendency. By leveraging the collective knowledge of innovators, this method can support dynamic research and foster rapid cycle learning.},

	abstract = {Improving the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability is essential for the problem of handling high-dimensional data in Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems and providing insights into real-world tasks. However, the TSK fuzzy system becomes complex and challenging to interpret as the data dimension increases. Here, we report an ensemble classifier, which is an enhanced adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) integrating improved bagging and dropout to build concise fuzzy rule sets. First, the high-dimensional feature space is decomposed into a series of low-dimensional feature subsets using the bagging and random subspace method to train multiple ANFISs. An improved dropout strategy is then applied in training ANFISs by temporarily disabling rules in each training epoch and deleting rules after training to obtain sparse rulesets with high-quality rules. These sub-models are subsequently aggregated to perform the fuzzy inference. Results on high-dimensional benchmark datasets confirm that both the bagging and dropout strategies are effective, providing high interpretability by reducing the co-firing degrees and rules of sub-models while guaranteeing accuracy at the same time.},

There are two main types of machine learning systems: white-box and black-box models. White-box models are inherently interpretable but commonly suffer from under-fitting phenomena; on the other hand, black-box models perform quite well in a wide range of application domain problems, but their reasoning behind a decision is hard or even impossible to understand. In the soft-computing area, fuzzy inference systems are rule-based systems that use fuzzy reasoning, bringing human perception modeling and computing with word capability. These rule-based systems are designed either manually or automatically but are commonly optimized to fit better some phenomena’ data (in a supervised learning task).

	abstract = {Learning an interval-valued fuzzy rule-based classification system is a challenge as its success directly depends on the interval-valued fuzzy partition used. In fact, the learning of an interval-valued fuzzy system usually starts by creating a partition composed of numerical fuzzy sets, which are used to build an initial fuzzy classifier. Then, it is augmented with interval-valued fuzzy sets whose shape is subsequently optimized to improve the system’s performance. However, as in this methodology the fuzzy rules are learned using numerical fuzzy sets, the benefits of the interval-valued fuzzy sets may not be fully exploited. In this paper we define a new learning methodology that avoids building the initial fuzzy classifier but directly learns interval-valued fuzzy rules. To do so, we define a wrapper methodology to learn the interval-valued fuzzy partitions such that they lead to an interval-valued fuzzy rule-based classification system as accurate as possible. Moreover, our new method allows one to represent each membership function using the most proper type of fuzzy set for the sake of modeling the uncertainty in the best possible manner. Consequently, the antecedents of the rules can be formed of only numerical fuzzy sets, only interval-valued fuzzy sets or a mixture of both. The quality of the proposal is compared versus four state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers like FARC-HD, IVTURS, FURIA and FARC-HD using an inference based on a generalization of the Choquet integral. We also compare our new approach besides its numerical fuzzy counterpart to clearly show the benefits of the usage of interval-valued fuzzy sets. Specifically, the average accuracy rate of our new method is 81.17\%, which is at least 0.66\% better than the remainder state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers.},

After transforming defuzzification to an equivalent form of softmax function, we find that the poor performance is due to the saturation of softmax. We show that two defuzzification operations, LogTSK and HTSK, the latter of which is first proposed in this paper, can avoid the saturation. Experimental results on datasets with various dimensionalities validated our analysis and demonstrated the effectiveness of LogTSK and HTSK.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of afﬁne distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and ﬁnally performing veriﬁcation through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

	abstract = {A novel pseudo-incremental ensemble rough set pseudo-outer product (PIE-RSPOP) fuzzy neural network is proposed for learning and prediction of trends in complex temporal series. It incorporates four theories pertaining to the learning and memorizing mechanisms in human beings. BCM theory of synaptic metaplasticity replaces Hebbian learning of weights of fuzzy rules and allows for a more natural associative–dissociative learning of weights. Short term forgetting of weights of the fuzzy rules is integrated for rules that are recalled and rules that are not recalled by an instance of data through Ebbinghaus theory of forgetting due to decay and displacement. The long term forgetting of networks in the ensemble is also incorporated through exponential decay of weights based on the age and strengths of the networks. Lastly, a hippocampal mechanism for caching the memories for subsequent recall is proposed. Another contribution of PIE-RSPOP is its ability to deal with concept drift and less storage of historical data. Lastly, despite the usually uninterpretable nature of incremental ensembles of fuzzy networks, a scheme to derive simple interpretable single knowledge base is also proposed. Variety of numerical results on standard datasets are used to demonstrate the advantages of PIE-RSPOP over other incremental learning methods.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, and with the current progress in technologies and business sales, databases with large amount of data exist especially in Retail Companies. The main objective of this study is to reduce the complexity of the classification problems while maintaining the prediction classification quality. We propose to apply the promising technique Rough set theory which is a new mathematical approach to data analysis based on classification of objects of interest into similarity classes, which are indiscernible with respect to some features. Since some features are of high interest, this leads to the fundamental concept of “Attribute Reduction”. The goal of Rough set is to enumerate good attribute subsets that have high dependence, discriminating index and significance. The naïve way of is to generate all possible subsets of attribute but in high dimension cases, this approach is very inefficient while it will require 2d 1 iterations. Therefore, we propose the Dynamic programming technique in order to enumerate dynamically the optimal subsets of the reduced attributes of high interest by reducing the degree of complexity. Implementation has been developed, applied, and tested over a 3 years historical business data in Retail Business (RB). Simulations and visual analysis are shown and discussed in order to validate the accuracy of the proposed tool.},

	abstract = {Background/purpose: Border (B) description of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions is one of the most important tasks for the clinical diagnosis of dermoscopy images using the ABCD rule. For an accurate description of the border, there must be an effective skin tumor area extraction (STAE) method. However, this task is complicated due to uneven illumination, artifacts present in the lesions and smooth areas or fuzzy borders of the desired regions. Methods: In this paper, a novel STAE algorithm based on improved dynamic programming (IDP) is presented. The STAE technique consists of the following four steps: color space transform, pre-processing, rough tumor area detection and refinement of the segmented area. The procedure is performed in the CIE L*a*b* color space, which is approximately uniform and is therefore related to dermatologist's perception. After pre-processing the skin lesions to reduce artifacts, the DP algorithm is improved by introducing a local cost function, which is based on color and texture weights. Results: The STAE method is tested on a total of 100 dermoscopic images. In order to compare the performance of STAE with other state-of-the-art algorithms, various statistical measures based on dermatologist-drawn borders are utilized as a ground truth. The proposed method outperforms the others with a sensitivity of 96.64\%, a specificity of 98.14\% and an error probability of 5.23\%. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that this STAE method by IDP is an effective solution when compared with other state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. The proposed method can accurately extract tumor borders in dermoscopy images.},

The concept of ({\textless}p,p′{\textgreater},{\textless}q,q′{\textgreater})-indiscernibility of a linear Diophantine fuzzy relation (LDF relation) is used for the construction of an LDFRS.

Since feature selection can achieve efficient feature reduction, it has become a key method for data preprocessing in many data mining tasks. Recently, many feature selection strategies have been developed since in most cases it is infeasible to obtain an optimal/reduced feature subset by using exhaustive search. Among these strategies, fuzzy rough set theory has proved to be an ideal candidate for dealing with uncertain information. This article provides a comprehensive review on the fuzzy rough set theory and two fuzzy rough set theory based feature selection methods, that is, fuzzy rough set based feature selection methods and fuzzy rough neural network based feature selection methods. We review the publications related to the fuzzy rough theory and its applications in feature selection. In addition, the challenges in the two types of feature selection methods are also discussed.

In this paper we argue that both notions aim to different purposes. Seen this way, it is more natural to try to combine the two models of uncertainty (vagueness and coarseness) rather than to have them compete on the same problems. First, one may think of deriving the upper and lower approximations of a fuzzy set, when a reference scale is coarsened by means of an equivalence relation. We then come close to Caianiello's C-calculus. Shafer's concept of coarsened belief functions also belongs to the same line of thought. Another idea is to turn the equivalence relation into a fuzzy similarity relation, for the modeling of coarseness, as already proposed by Farinas del Cerro and Prade. Instead of using a similarity relation, we can start with fuzzy granules which make a fuzzy partition of the reference scale. The main contribution of the paper is to clarify the difference between fuzzy sets and rough sets, and unify several independent works which deal with similar ideas in different settings or notations.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the complementary benefits of embedding a deep learning model as a fully data-driven fuzzy implication operator of a five-layer neuro-fuzzy system for learning and explanations for the predictions of both steady-state and dynamically changing data. In traditional Mandani-type neuro-fuzzy systems, the entailment performed by the implication is realized using the fuzzy implication operator based on the fuzzy rules formed in the rule base during encoding and recall. Given the presence of a group of test data that are significantly different from the training data, the realization of entailments through the use of the implication operator based on the fuzzy rules formed in traditional neuro-fuzzy systems may not be adequate. This paper attempts to adopt a more direct approach by embedding a deep learning model in the neuro-fuzzy system to serve as a fuzzy implication operator, thereby allowing the data-driven learning of fuzzy implication using the deep structure to provide a close correspondence to the real-world entailment of data. In addition, embedding the neuro-fuzzy architecture within the deep learning model allows the comprehension of the learning and explanation of the reasoning of the deep network. The induced fuzzy association rules impart transparency to the deep learning based implication using a common set of semantic meanings, which are amenable to human interpretability. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on a continuously stirred tank reactor dataset and three financial stock prediction datasets. Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperformed other state-of-the-art techniques based on the four datasets, which contain high levels of uncertainties.},

Fuzzy algorithms have been proposed to process numerical data using intervals, particularly fuzzy intervals, but none of these methods is satisfactory. Therefore this paper completely deﬁnes the concepts linked to fuzzy sequential pattern mining.

An example is that large purchase amounts of one product were bought by customers after these consumers had bought small purchase amounts of another product. Recently, Hu et al. (2003) proposed a fuzzy data mining method to discover fuzzy sequential patterns. In this method, consumers’ products preferences and consumers’ product buying orders related to purchase behaviors can be found in the fuzzy sequential pattern mining. Since for each decision problem, there is a competence set consisting of ideas, knowledge, information, and skills for solving that problem, we consider knowledge found in fuzzy sequential pattern mining as a needed competence set for solving one decision problem. This paper uses a known competence set expansion method, the minimum spanning table method, to find appropriate two-stage learning sequences that can effectively acquire individual fuzzy knowledge sets found in the fuzzy sequential pattern mining.

A new mining algorithm is proposed, which integrates the fuzzy-set concepts and the AprioriAll algorithm. It first transforms quantitative values in transactions into linguistic terms, then filters them to find sequential patterns by modifying the AprioriAll mining algorithm. Each quantitative item uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in later mining processes, thus making the number of fuzzy regions to be processed the same as the number of the original items. The patterns mined out thus exhibit the sequential quantitative regularity in databases and can be used to provide some Suggestions to appropriate supervisors.},

	abstract = {Sequential pattern mining is to discover all subsequences that are frequent. The classical sequential pattern mining algorithms do not allow processing of numerical data and require preprocessing of these data into a binary representation, which necessarily leads to a loss of information. Fuzzy sets are used to overcome this problem. In present fuzzy sequential pattern mining algorithms, there isn't any matter of itemset time and sequences are only found based on sequence of happening. In this paper, a novel fuzzy sequential pattern algorithm is proposed with sliding window constraint which permits elements of a pattern to span a set of transactions within a user-specified window. Therefore, loss of useful sequences is prevented in the search process. The proposed algorithm searches for a goal sequence within the defined fuzzy sliding window and the membership degree of sliding window is returned if the goal sequence is found.},

Focused on this purpose, in this paper, a novel recurrent mechanism as well as a solution for filtering IN based on Lyapunov stability theory is proposed to establish an adaptive online IN filter (AOINF). Using the AOINF, kernel fuzzy-C-means clustering method, and the least mean squares method, a cluster data space deriving from the filtered IDS is created to which the ANFIS is then formed. The recurrent mechanism executes filtering IN to build ANFIS and using the ANFIS as an updated-filter to filter IN synchronously until either the ANFIS converges to the desired accuracy or a stop condition is satisfied. Surveys, including identifying dynamic response of a magnetorheological damper via measuring datasets, are performed to evaluate the proposed method.},

The proposed neural architecture considered as a universal defuzzification approximator is validated by showing the convergence when approximating several existing defuzzification strategies. The method is successfully tested with fuzzy controlled reverse driving of a model truck. The transparent structure of the universal defuzzification approximator allows us to analyze the generated customized defuzzification method using the existing theories of defuzzification. The integration of universal defuzzification approximator instead of traditional methods in Mamdani-type fuzzy controllers can also be considered as an addition of trainable nonlinear noise to the output of the fuzzy rule inference before calculating the defuzzified crisp output. Therefore, nonlinear noise trained specifically for a given application shows a grade of confidence on the rule base, providing an additional opportunity to measure the quality of the fuzzy rule base. The possibility of modeling a Mamdani-type fuzzy controller as a feedforward neural network with the ability of gradient descent training of the universal defuzzification approximator and antecedent membership functions fulfil the requirement known from multilayer preceptrons in finding solutions to nonlinear separable problems.},

The neuro-fuzzy system can learn its knowledge base from input-output training data. A plant model is not required for training, that is, the plant is unknown to the SO-NFS. Using new data types, the vectors and matrices, a construction theory is developed for the organization process and the inference activities of the cluster-based SO-NFS. With the construction theory, a compact equation for describing the relation between the input base variables and inference results is established. This equation not only gives the inference relation between inputs and outputs but also specifies the linguistic meanings in the process. New pseudo-error learning control is proposed for closed-loop control applications. Using a cluster-based algorithm, the neuro-fuzzy system in its genesis can be generated by the stimulation of input/output training data to have its initial control policy (IF-THEN rules) for application. With the well-known random optimization method, the generated neuro-fuzzy system can learn its data base for specific applications.

The proposed RNN-FLCS is constructed by integrating two neural-network-based fuzzy logic controllers (NN-FLC's), each of which is a connectionist model with a feedforward multilayered network developed for the realization of a fuzzy logic controller. One NN-FLC performs as a fuzzy predictor, and the other as a fuzzy controller. Using the temporal difference prediction method, the fuzzy predictor can predict the external reinforcement signal and provide a more informative internal reinforcement signal to the fuzzy controller. The fuzzy controller performs a stochastic exploratory algorithm to adapt itself according to the internal reinforcement signal. During the learning process, both structure learning and parameter learning are performed simultaneously in the two NN-FLC's using the fuzzy similarity measure. The proposed RNN-FLCS can construct a fuzzy logic control and decision-making system automatically and dynamically through a reward/penalty signal or through very simple fuzzy information feedback such as "high," "too high," "low," and "too low." The proposed RNN-FLCS is best applied to the learning environment, where obtaining exact training data is expensive. It also preserves the advantages of the original NN-FLC, such as the ability to find proper network structure and parameters simultaneously and dynamically and to avoid the rule-matching time of the inference engine.

From this perspective, the tuning of controller parameters has been carried out using perturbation and observation methods, computational tools based on optimization algorithms for low-complexity systems, and more recently, using metaheuristic algorithms for highly complex systems with improved tuning procedures that guarantee the operation and stability of the systems. Thus, avant-garde optimization algorithms that mimic the evolution of self-organizing biological systems, also called metaheuristic nature-inspired algorithms, have gained high relevance due to their great potential for solving optimization problems. Hence, the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm, a very promising and nearly recent developed nature-inspired algorithm, has been used in the design and optimization of Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) systems due to its great potentiality. In particular, this chapter studies the application of the CS algorithm for tuning controller parameters in two different case studies. The first one is associated with the FLC parameter tuning of a nonlinear magnetic levitation system, and the second case study is related to the FLC optimization of the energy management system of a residential microgrid. Simulation results are provided to emphasize and analyze the features of the optimized controllers for the two cases and compared against other more conventional techniques. Obtained outcomes show that the adjustment of FLC parameters, performed through the CS algorithm, is efficient and improves the performance of the two FLC, which makes the CS algorithm becomes a powerful alternative for performing the controller parameter tuning in modern control systems.},

By using a hybrid learning procedure, the proposed ANFIS can construct an input-output mapping based on both human knowledge (in the form of fuzzy if-then rules) and stipulated input-output data pairs. In the simulation, the ANFIS architecture is employed to model nonlinear functions, identify nonlinear components on-line in a control system, and predict a chaotic time series, all yielding remarkable results.

Rule generation from artificial neural networks is gaining in popularity in recent times due to its capability of providing some insight to the user about the symbolic knowledge embedded within the network. Fuzzy sets are an aid in providing this information in a more human comprehensible or natural form, and can handle uncertainties at various levels. The neuro-fuzzy approach, symbiotically combining the merits of connectionist and fuzzy approaches, constitutes a key component of soft computing at this stage. To date, there has been no detailed and integrated categorization of the various neuro-fuzzy models used for rule generation. We propose to bring these together under a unified soft computing framework. Moreover, we include both rule extraction and rule refinement in the broader perspective of rule generation. Rules learned and generated for fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy control are also considered from this wider viewpoint. Models are grouped on the basis of their level of neuro-fuzzy synthesis. Use of other soft computing tools like genetic algorithms and rough sets are emphasized. Rule generation from fuzzy knowledge-based networks, which initially encode some crude domain knowledge, are found to result in more refined rules. Finally, real-life application to medical diagnosis is provided.},

This results in the acquisition of operant memory by the contingently reinforced animals. Analysis of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the feeding motor circuitry revealed that activity-dependent neuronal modulation occurs at the interneurons that mediate feeding behaviors. This provides evidence that interneurons are possible loci of plasticity and constitute another mechanism for memory storage in addition to memory storage attributed to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. In this paper, an associative ambiguity correction-based neuro-fuzzy network, called appetitive reward-based pseudo-outer-product-compositional rule of inference [ARPOP-CRI(S)], is trained based on an appetitive reward-based learning algorithm which is biologically inspired by the appetitive operant conditioning of the feeding behavior in Aplysia. A variant of the Hebbian learning rule called Hebbian concomitant learning is proposed as the building block in the neuro-fuzzy network learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm possesses the distinguishing features of the sequential learning algorithm. In addition, the proposed ARPOP-CRI(S) neuro-fuzzy system encodes fuzzy knowledge in the form of linguistic rules that satisfies the semantic criteria for low-level fuzzy model interpretability. ARPOP-CRI(S) is evaluated and compared against other modeling techniques using benchmark time-series datasets. Experimental results are encouraging and show that ARPOP-CRI(S) is a viable modeling technique for time-variant problem domains.},

There have been many studies analyzing the impact of different population sizes on the performance of EAs. However, most of such studies are based on computational experiments, except for a few cases. The common wisdom so far appears to be that a large population would increase the population diversity and thus help an EA. Indeed, increasing the population size has been a commonly used strategy in tuning an EA when it did not perform as well as expected for a given problem. He and Yao (2002) [8] showed theoretically that for some problem instance classes, a population can help to reduce the runtime of an EA from exponential to polynomial time. This paper analyzes the role of population further in EAs and shows rigorously that large populations may not always be useful. Conditions, under which large populations can be harmful, are discussed in this paper. Although the theoretical analysis was carried out on one multimodal problem using a specific type of EAs, it has much wider implications. The analysis has revealed certain problem characteristics, which can be either the problem considered here or other problems, that lead to the disadvantages of large population sizes. The analytical approach developed in this paper can also be applied to analyzing EAs on other problems.},

The ASuPFuNIS model extends SuPFuNIS by permitting signal and weight fuzzy sets to be modeled by asymmetric Gaussian membership functions. The asymmetric subsethood product network admits both numeric as well as linguistic inputs. Numeric inputs are fuzzified prior to their application to the network; linguistic inputs are presented without modification. The network architecture directly embeds fuzzy if-then rules, and connections represent antecedent and consequent fuzzy sets. The model uses mutual subsethood based activation spread and a product aggregation operator that works in conjunction with volume defuzzification in a gradient descent learning framework. The model is economical in terms of the number of rules required to solve difficult problems and is robust against random variations in data sets. Simulation results on three benchmark problems-the Hepatitis diagnosis, Iris data classification and the Narazaki-Ralescu function approximation problem-show that the subsethood based model performs excellently with minimal number of rules.},

	abstract = {There are generally two approaches to the design of a neural fuzzy system: (1) design by human experts, and (2) design through a self-organization of the numerical training data. While the former approach is highly subjective, the latter is commonly plagued by one or more of the following major problems: (1) an inconsistent rulebase; (2) the need for prior knowledge such as the number of clusters to be computed; (3) heuristically designed knowledge acquisition methodologies; and (4) the stability-plasticity tradeoff of the system. This paper presents a novel self-organizing neural fuzzy system, named Self-Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Network (SaFIN), to address the aforementioned deficiencies. The proposed SaFIN model employs a new clustering technique referred to as categorical learning-induced partitioning (CLIP), which draws inspiration from the behavioral category learning process demonstrated by humans. By employing the one-pass CLIP, SaFIN is able to incorporate new clusters in each input-output dimension when the existing clusters are not able to give a satisfactory representation of the incoming training data. This not only avoids the need for prior knowledge regarding the number of clusters needed for each input-output dimension, but also allows SaFIN the flexibility to incorporate new knowledge with old knowledge in the system. In addition, the self-automated rule formation mechanism proposed within SaFIN ensures that it obtains a consistent resultant rulebase. Subsequently, the proposed SaFIN model is employed in a series of benchmark simulations to demonstrate its efficiency as a self-organizing neural fuzzy system, and excellent performances have been achieved.},

First, an effective criterion, using the tracking performance and structure risk of controller, is developed to self-organize the control rules online for SOIC to improve the tracking performance. Second, the structure and parameters of SOIC are updated by an adaptive projection-type algorithm to reduce the heavy computational burden to speed up the control response. Third, the stability of SOIC is proved in the sense of Lyapunov and the guidelines for selecting the control parameters are given. Finally, the effectiveness of SOIC is illustrated with three nonlinear systems.

	abstract = {Earlier clustering techniques such as the modified learning vector quantization (MLVQ) and the fuzzy Kohonen partitioning (FKP) techniques have focused on the derivation of a certain set of parameters so as to define the fuzzy sets in terms of an algebraic function. The fuzzy membership functions thus generated are uniform, normal, and convex. Since any irregular training data is clustered into uniform fuzzy sets (Gaussian, triangular, or trapezoidal), the clustering may not be exact and some amount of information may be lost. In this paper, two clustering techniques using a Kohonen-like self-organizing neural network architecture, namely, the unsupervised discrete clustering technique (UDCT) and the supervised discrete clustering technique (SDCT), are proposed. The UDCT and SDCT algorithms reduce this data loss by introducing nonuniform, normal fuzzy sets that are not necessarily convex. The training data range is divided into discrete points at equal intervals, and the membership value corresponding to each discrete point is generated. Hence, the fuzzy sets obtained contain pairs of values, each pair corresponding to a discrete point and its membership grade. Thus, it can be argued that fuzzy membership functions generated using this kind of a discrete methodology provide a more accurate representation of the actual input data. This fact has been demonstrated by comparing the membership functions generated by the UDCT and SDCT algorithms against those generated by the MLVQ, FKP, and pseudofuzzy Kohonen partitioning (PFKP) algorithms. In addition to these clustering techniques, a novel pattern classifying network called the Yager fuzzy neural network (FNN) is proposed in this paper. This network corresponds completely to the Yager inference rule and exhibits remarkable generalization abilities. A modified version of the pseudo-outer product (POP)-Yager FNN called the modified Yager FNN is introduced that eliminates the drawbacks of the earlier network and yields superior performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted to test the effectiveness of these two networks, using various clustering algorithms. It follows that the SDCT and UDCT clustering algorithms are particularly suited to networks based on the Yager inference rule.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy neural networks (FNNs), with suitable structures, have been demonstrated to be an effective tool in approximating nonlinearity between input and output variables. However, it is time-consuming to construct an FNN with appropriate number of fuzzy rules to ensure its generalization ability. To solve this problem, an efficient optimization technique is introduced in this paper. First, a self-adaptive structural optimal algorithm (SASOA) is developed to minimize the structural risk of an FNN, leading to an improved generalization performance. Second, with the proposed SASOA, the fuzzy rules of SASOA-based FNN (SASOA-FNN) are generated or pruned systematically. This SASOA-FNN is able to organize the structure and adjust the parameters simultaneously in the learning process. Third, the convergence of SASOA-FNN is proved in the cases with fixed and updated structures, and the guidelines for selecting the parameters are given. Finally, experimental studies of the proposed SASOA-FNN have been performed on several nonlinear systems to verify the effectiveness. The comparison with other existing methods has been made, and it demonstrates that the proposed SASOA-FNN is of better performance.},

	abstract = {Intelligent computing technologies are useful and important for online data modeling, where system dynamics may be nonstationary with some uncertainties. In this paper, an efficient learning mechanism is developed for building self-organizing fuzzy neural networks (SOFNNs), where a second-order algorithm (SOA) with adaptive learning rate is employed, the network size and the parameters can be determined simultaneously in the learning process. First, all parameters of SOFNN are adjusted by using the SOA strategy to achieve fast convergence through a powerful search scheme. Second, the structure of SOFNN can be self-organized using the relative importance index of each rule. The fuzzy rules used in SOFNN with SOA (SOA-SOFNN) are generated or pruned automatically to reduce the computational complexity and potentially improve the generalization power. Finally, a theoretical analysis on the learning convergence of the proposed SOA-SOFNN is given to show the computational efficiency. To demonstrate the merits of our proposed approach for data modeling, several benchmark datasets, and a real world application associated with nonlinear systems modeling problems are examined with comparisons against other existing methods. The results indicate that our proposed SOA-SOFNN performs favorably in terms of both learning speed and prediction accuracy for online data modeling.},

The self-tuning method using the descent method has been proposed by Ichihashi et al.

But this method does not have a sufficient generalization capability or an expressing capability for the acquired knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new learning method called a destructive method of fuzzy inference rules by the descent method. And we show that the destructive method is superior in the number of rules and inference errors but inferior in learning speed to the constructive one. Further more, in order to improve learning speed, we propose a learning method combining the constructive and the destructive methods. Some numerical examples are given to show the validity of the proposed methods, and applications of these methods to the obstacle avoidance problem are shown.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Data mining is a critical technology for extracting valuable knowledge from databases. It has been used in many fields, like retail, finance, biology, etc. In computational intelligence, fuzzy logic has been applied in many intelligent systems widely because it is simple and similar to human inference. Fuzzy utility mining combines utility mining and fuzzy logic for getting linguistic utility knowledge. In this paper, we study a more challenging, complicated, but practical topic called temporal fuzzy utility data mining, which considers the temporal periods in transactions, purchased amounts, item profits, and understandable linguistic terms as important factors. Although an Apriori-based algorithm was proposed previously, its execution was not efficient. We thus use a modified tree structure based on the classical frequent-pattern tree to improve its performance. A tree-based mining algorithm is also proposed to mine temporal fuzzy utility itemsets from quantitative transactional databases. The tree structure is built to keep all temporal fuzzy utility 1-itemsets in a database. All the high temporal fuzzy utility itemsets in a database can be obtained by traversing the tree-based structure. The proposed algorithm gets the final results through two phases. In the first phase, a procedure like FP-Growth is used to find the candidate itemsets. In the second phase, the temporal fuzzy utility database is scanned to decide whether the candidate itemsets are desired. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing algorithm for temporal fuzzy utility mining in terms of processing time and used memory.},

Thus, we extend SN P systems by introducing some new ingredients (such as three types of neurons, fuzzy logic and new firing mechanism) and propose the fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems). The FRSN P systems are particularly suitable to model fuzzy production rules in a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base and their reasoning process. Moreover, a parallel fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on FRSN P systems is developed according to neuron’s dynamic firing mechanism. Besides, a practical example of transformer fault diagnosis is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed FRSN P systems in fault diagnosis problem.},

For distinguishing between degrees of similarity or dissimilarity, certain measures were clearly superior and others were clearly inferior; for a few subjects, however, none of the distance measures adequately modeled their similarity judgments. Measures that account for ordering on the base variable proved to be more highly correlated with subjects' actual similarity judgments. And, surprisingly, the best measures were ones that focus on only one “slice” of the membership function. Such measures are easiest to compute and may provide insight into the way humans judge similarity among fuzzy concepts.},

The functions performed by each layer in the proposed POPFNN strictly correspond to the inference steps in the truth value restriction method in fuzzy logic [Mantaras (1990) Approximate reasoning models, Ellis Horwood]. This correspondence gives it a strong theoretical basis. Similar to most of the existing fuzzy neural networks, the proposed POPFNN uses a self-organizing algorithm (Kohonen, 1988, Self-organization and associative memories, Springer) to learn and initialize the membership functions of the input and output variables from a set of training data. However, instead of employing the popularly used competitive learning [Kosko (1990) IEEE Trans.

The proposed POP learning algorithm is fast, reliable, and highly intuitive. Extensive experimental results and comparisons are presented at the end of the paper for discussion.

Multiple sequence learning is important in performing habitual and skillful tasks, such as writing, signing signatures, and playing piano. Generally, it is indispensable for pattern generation applications. Since multiple sequences have similar parts, local information such as some previous samples is not sufficient to efficiently reproduce them. Instead, it is necessary to consider global and discriminative information, maybe in the very initial samples of each sequence, to first recognize them, and then predict their next sample based on the current local information. Therefore, the structure of the proposed network consists of two parts: 1) sequence identifier, which computes a novel sequence identity value based on initial samples of a sequence, and detects the sequence identity based on proper fuzzy rules and 2) sequence locator, which locates the input sample in the sequence. Therefore, by integrating outputs of these two parts in fuzzy rules, the network is able to produce the proper output based on the current state of each sequence. To learn the proposed structure, a gradual learning procedure is proposed. First, learning is performed by adding new fuzzy rules, based on coverage measure, using available correct data. Next, the initialized parameters are fine-tuned, by the gradient descent algorithm, based on fed back approximated network output as the next input. The proposed method has a dynamic structure able to learn new sequences online. Finally, to investigate the effectiveness of the presented approach, it is used to simultaneously learn and reproduce multiple sequences in different applications, including sequences with similar parts, different patterns, and writing different letters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with other existing methods, including the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, GDFNN, CFNN, and long short-term memory (LSTM). According to these experiments, the proposed method outperforms traditional FNNs and LSTM in learning multiple sequences.},

	abstract = {The main strengths of collaborative filtering (CF), the most successful and widely used filtering technique for recommender systems, are its cross-genre or ‘outside the box’ recommendation ability and that it is completely independent of any machine-readable representation of the items being recommended. However, CF suffers from sparsity, scalability, and loss of neighbor transitivity. CF techniques are either memory-based or model-based. While the former is more accurate, its scalability compared to model-based is poor. An important contribution of this paper is a hybrid fuzzy-genetic approach to recommender systems that retains the accuracy of memory-based CF and the scalability of model-based CF. Using hybrid features, a novel user model is built that helped in achieving significant reduction in system complexity, sparsity, and made the neighbor transitivity relationship hold. The user model is employed to find a set of like-minded users within which a memory-based search is carried out. This set is much smaller than the entire set, thus improving system’s scalability. Besides our proposed approaches are scalable and compact in size, computational results reveal that they outperform the classical approach.},

	abstract = {Employing an effective learning process is a critical topic in designing a fuzzy neural network, especially when expert knowledge is not available. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based learning approach for a specific type of fuzzy neural network. The proposed learning approach consists of three stages. In the first stage the membership functions of both input and output variables are initialized by determining their centers and widths using a self-organizing algorithm. The second stage employs the proposed GA based learning algorithm to identify the fuzzy rules while the final stage tunes the derived structure and parameters using a back-propagation learning algorithm. The capabilities of the proposed GA-based learning approach are evaluated using a well-examined benchmark example and its effectiveness is analyzed by means of a comparative study with other approaches. The usefulness of the proposed GA-based learning approach is also illustrated in a practical case study where it is used to predict the performance of road traffic control actions. Results from the benchmarking exercise and case study effectively demonstrate the ability of the proposed three stages learning approach to identify relevant fuzzy rules from a training data set with a higher prediction accuracy than alternative approaches.},

One way to overcome this problem is to decide the utilized linguistic variables, partitioning the linguistic variable and the rule base together, in order to only evolve very simple, but still accurate models. In order to accomplish these, we propose a novel 2-tuple linguistic fuzzy model and linguistic fuzzy partitioning technique. Our propose 2-tuple linguistic fuzzy logic controller tackles the curse of dimensionality problem in high-dimensional regression problems when the number of input and output variables becomes high. The linguistic information can be expressed by means of 2-tuples (S,α), where S is the linguistic term and α is the numeric value between [-0.5, 0.5]. Here, tackle 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic model capable for making processes of computing with words (CW) without loss of information. In order to validate our proposed method, we solve the high dimensional regression problem: length and maintenance cost estimation of low and medium voltage line respectively. We present extensive simulation results in order to demonstrate the simplicity and superiority of the proposed technique while comparing with other methods.},

	abstract = {In real-world applications, transactions are typically represented by quantitative data. Thus, fuzzy association rule mining algorithms have been proposed to handle these quantitative transactions. In addition, items generally have certain lifespans or temporal periods in which they exist in a database. Therefore, fuzzy temporal association rule mining algorithms have also been proposed in the literature. A key factor in the acquisition of fuzzy temporal association rules (FTARs) is the design of appropriate membership functions. Because current approaches have been designed to generate membership functions for mining fuzzy association rules (FARs) in market-basket analysis, in this paper, we propose a membership function tuning mechanism for a fuzzy temporal association rule mining algorithm. The proposed approach modifies an existing cluster-based method to generate unique membership functions that are specifically tailored to each item in a dataset. Two factors are utilized to decide the appropriate membership functions of each item: (1) the density similarity among intervals corresponding to the density similarity within intervals, and (2) the information closeness within an interval corresponding to the similarity in the number of data points between intervals. A parameter θ is used to indicate the relative importance of these two factors. As a result, the membership functions are generated based on the quantitative ranges of individual items, and the generated membership functions of items are different in terms of the values of each interval and the number of intervals. The generated membership functions are subsequently used in a fuzzy temporal association rule mining algorithm. Computational experiments were conducted on both a synthetic dataset and a real-world one to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Therefore, genetic algorithm will be useful for the above model. However, the computational complexity of genetic algorithm is much larger than the steepest descent method. Also, since all input items are set to the antecedent parts in typical fuzzy inference model, the number of rules increases exponentially. Moreover, considering the computational complexity of genetic algorithm, it will not be necessarily suitable. On the other hand, Single Input Connected (SIC) fuzzy inference model sets the fuzzy rule of 1 input 1 output, so the number of rules can be reduced drastically. The consequent parts of the conventional SIC model were real number although linguistic interpretation is possible and easy to understand if the consequent parts are fuzzy sets. Therefore, we propose a new SIC model which extends real number of the consequent parts to fuzzy sets, and the fuzzy rules are derived by using genetic algorithm. In addition, it is applied to a medical diagnosis and compared with the conventional fuzzy inference models.},

The methodologies of model design can be mainly divided into two groups: the semantic-driven modelling and the data-driven modelling. The first model design type proposes models which are built based on expert knowledge. However, it is often the case that the model contains redundant rules and /or variables, so there is a need to reduce the redundancy of the model. The second model design type became more popular in the last decade partly due to the fact that fuzzy models were found to be able to approximate with arbitrary accuracy any continuous control function. These models usually use tremendously large number of rules and do not take into account the complexity of the model. This characteristic also emerged the issue of rule base reduction. The present paper summarizes the efforts done on the complexity reduction field.},

Many studies have claimed that reducing the complexity of FLSs can lead to improved model interpretability. That is, reducing the number of rules tends to reduce the complexity of FLSs, thus improving their interpretability. However, none of these studies have considered interpretability and complexity from human perspectives. Since interpretability is of a subjective nature, it is essential to see how people perceive interpretability and complexity particularly in relation to creating FLSs. Therefore, in this paper we have investigated this issue using an initial user study. This is the ﬁrst time that a user study has been used to assess the interpretability and complexity of designs in relation to creating FLSs. The user study involved a range of expert practitioners in FLSs and received a diverse set of answers. We are interested to see whether, from the perspectives of people, FLSs are necessarily more interpretable when they are less complex in terms of their design. Although the initial user study is based on small samples (i.e., 25 participants), nevertheless this research provides initial insight into this issue that motivates our future research.},

In the rule base, the redundant rules are removed by setting their all consequents weight factor to zero and merging the conflicting rules during the learning process. The real and binary coded coupled genetic algorithms are applied for generating the optimal controllers that reduce the rule base size and optimal selection of fuzzy sets. Optimizing the MFs of FLCs with learning and reducing the number of fuzzy control rules concurrently represents a way to improve the computational efficiency and interpretability of FLCs to minimize the errors.

	abstract = {Fuzzy logic is a powerful tool to model knowledge uncertainty, measurements imprecision, and vagueness. However, there is another type of vagueness that arises when data have multiple forms of expression that fuzzy logic does not address quite well. This is the case for multiple instance learning problems (MIL). In MIL, an object is represented by a collection of instances, called a bag. A bag is labeled negative if all of its instances are negative, and positive if at least one of its instances is positive. Positive bags encode ambiguity since the instances themselves are not labeled. In this paper, we introduce fuzzy inference systems and neural networks designed to handle bags of instances as input and capable of learning from ambiguously labeled data. First, we introduce the Multiple Instance Sugeno style fuzzy inference (MI-Sugeno) that extends the standard Sugeno style inference to handle reasoning with multiple instances. Second, we use MI-Sugeno to define and develop Multiple Instance Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (MI-ANFIS). We expand the architecture of the standard ANFIS to allow reasoning with bags and derive a learning algorithm using backpropagation to identify the premise and consequent parameters of the network. The proposed inference system is tested and validated using synthetic and benchmark datasets suitable for MIL problems. We also apply the proposed MI-ANFIS to fuse the output of multiple discrimination algorithms for the purpose of landmine detection using Ground Penetrating Radar.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has significantly improved 2D image recognition. Extending into 3D may advance many new applications including autonomous vehicles, virtual and augmented reality, authoring 3D content, and even improving 2D recognition. However despite growing interest, 3D deep learning remains relatively underexplored. We believe that some of this disparity is due to the engineering challenges involved in 3D deep learning, such as efficiently processing heterogeneous data and reframing graphics operations to be differentiable. We address these challenges by introducing PyTorch3D, a library of modular, efficient, and differentiable operators for 3D deep learning. It includes a fast, modular differentiable renderer for meshes and point clouds, enabling analysis-by-synthesis approaches. Compared with other differentiable renderers, PyTorch3D is more modular and efficient, allowing users to more easily extend it while also gracefully scaling to large meshes and images. We compare the PyTorch3D operators and renderer with other implementations and demonstrate significant speed and memory improvements. We also use PyTorch3D to improve the state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D mesh and point cloud prediction from 2D images on ShapeNet. PyTorch3D is open-source and we hope it will help accelerate research in 3D deep learning.},

Soft Computing (SC) consists of several computing paradigms, including fuzzy logic, n- ral networks, and genetic algorithms, which can be used to produce powerful hybrid intelligent systems for solving problems in pattern recognition, time series prediction, intelligent control, robotics and automation. Hybrid intelligent systems that combine several SC techniques are needed due to the complexity and high dimensionality of real-world problems. Hybrid intelligent systems can have different architectures, which have an impact on the efficiency and accuracy of these systems, for this reason it is very important to optimize architecture design. The architectures can combine, in different ways, neural networks, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms, to achieve the ultimate goal of pattern recognition, time series prediction, intelligent control, or other application areas. This book is intended to be a major reference for scientists and engineers interested in applying new computational and mathematical tools to design hybrid intelligent systems. This book can also be used as a reference for graduate courses like the f- lowing: soft computing, intelligent pattern recognition, computer vision, applied ar- ficial intelligence, and similar ones.

Subsequent chapters deal with approximate reasoning; information processing; decision and management sciences; and membership, cognition, neural networks, and learning. Numerical methods for fuzzy clustering are described, and adaptive inference in fuzzy knowledge networks is analyzed.

In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

	abstract = {The AI community is increasingly putting its attention towards combining symbolic and neural approaches, as it is often argued that the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are complementary. One recent trend in the literature are weakly supervised learning techniques that employ operators from fuzzy logics. In particular, these use prior background knowledge described in such logics to help the training of a neural network from unlabeled and noisy data. By interpreting logical symbols using neural networks, this background knowledge can be added to regular loss functions, hence making reasoning a part of learning. We study, both formally and empirically, how a large collection of logical operators from the fuzzy logic literature behave in a differentiable learning setting. We find that many of these operators, including some of the most well-known, are highly unsuitable in this setting. A further finding concerns the treatment of implication in these fuzzy logics, and shows a strong imbalance between gradients driven by the antecedent and the consequent of the implication. Furthermore, we introduce a new family of fuzzy implications (called sigmoidal implications) to tackle this phenomenon. Finally, we empirically show that it is possible to use Differentiable Fuzzy Logics for semi-supervised learning, and compare how different operators behave in practice. We find that, to achieve the largest performance improvement over a supervised baseline, we have to resort to non-standard combinations of logical operators which perform well in learning, but no longer satisfy the usual logical laws.},

In this article, we propose a new method called the Shape Fuzzy C-Means (SFCM) algorithm, which is constructed based on the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm with particular features of the Mapper algorithm. The SFCM algorithm can not only exhibit the same clustering ability as the Fuzzy C-Means but also reveal some relationships through visualizing the global shape of data supplied by the Mapper. We present a formal proof and include experiments to confirm our claims. The performance of the enhanced algorithm is demonstrated through a comparative analysis involving the original algorithm, Mapper, and the other fuzzy set based improved algorithm, F-Mapper, for synthetic and real-world data.

DENFIS evolve through incremental, hybrid (supervised/unsupervised), learning, and accommodate new input data, including new features, new classes, etc., through local element tuning. New fuzzy rules are created and updated during the operation of the system. At each time moment, the output of DENFIS is calculated through a fuzzy inference system based on m-most activated fuzzy rules which are dynamically chosen from a fuzzy rule set. Two approaches are proposed: (1) dynamic creation of a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy rule set for a DENFIS online model; and (2) creation of a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy rule set, or an expanded high-order one, for a DENFIS offline model. A set of fuzzy rules can be inserted into DENFIS before or during its learning process. Fuzzy rules can also be extracted during or after the learning process. An evolving clustering method (ECM), which is employed in both online and offline DENFIS models, is also introduced. It is demonstrated that DENFIS can effectively learn complex temporal sequences in an adaptive way and outperform some well-known, existing models.},

The proposed method can be applied to an on-line incremental adaptive learning for the prediction and control of nonlinear dynamical systems. Two benchmark case studies are used to demonstrate that the proposed HyFIS system is a superior neuro-fuzzy modelling technique.},

Improved control and optimization of WWTP lead to increased pollutant removal, a reduced need for chemicals as well as energy savings. An important step toward the optimal functioning of a WWTP is to minimize the influence of sensor faults on the control quality. To achieve this, a fault-detection system should be implemented. In this paper, the idea of using an evolving method as a base for the fault-detection/monitoring system is tested. The system is based on the evolving fuzzy model method. This method allows us to model the nonlinear relations between the variables with the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. The method uses basic evolving mechanisms to add and remove clusters and the adaptation mechanism to adapt the clusters' and local models' parameters. The proposed fault-detection system is tested on measured data from a real WWTP. The results indicate the potential improvement of the WWTP's control during a sensor malfunction.},

	abstract = {Among the existing global optimization algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of the most effective methods for non-linear and complex high-dimensional problems. Since PSO performance strongly depends on the choice of its settings (i.e., inertia, cognitive and social factors, minimum and maximum velocity), Fuzzy Logic (FL) was previously exploited to select these values. So far, FL-based implementations of PSO aimed at the calculation of a unique settings for the whole swarm. In this work we propose a novel self-tuning algorithm—called Fuzzy Self-Tuning PSO (FST-PSO)—which exploits FL to calculate the inertia, cognitive and social factor, minimum and maximum velocity independently for each particle, thus realizing a complete settings-free version of PSO. The novelty and strength of FST-PSO lie in the fact that it does not require any expertise in PSO functioning, since the behavior of every particle is automatically and dynamically adjusted during the optimization. We compare the performance of FST-PSO with standard PSO, Proactive Particles in Swarm Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony, Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, Differential Evolution and Genetic Algorithms. We empirically show that FST-PSO can basically outperform all tested algorithms with respect to the convergence speed and is competitive concerning the best solutions found, noticeably with a reduced computational effort.},

The fuzzy system contains fuzzy neurons modeled using t-norms and s-norms. The neural network is composed by nonlinear elements placed in series with the fuzzy system. The network model implicitly encodes a fuzzy rule-based system and its recurrent multilayered structure performs fuzzy inference. The topology induces a clear relationship between the network structure and the associated fuzzy rule-based system. Network learning involves three main steps. The first step uses a modified vector quantization approach to granulate the input universes. The next step assembles the network connections and their initial, randomly chosen weights. The third step uses two main paradigms to update the network weights: gradient descent and gradient projection method. The recurrent fuzzy neural network is particularly suitable to model nonlinear dynamic systems and to learn sequences. Computational experiment with a classic prediction problem benchmark shows that the fuzzy neural model outperforms a finite impulse response neural network.},

SNNs are computationally more powerful than conventional artificial neural networks. In this paper, the spiking neuron model is applied to represent logic rules and fuzzy rules. Based on the STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity) principle, a new SNN model is proposed for pattern recognition. An efficient learning rule derived from the STDP is applied for self-organizing the input training set efficiently. An example, Animal-Growth-Record, is used to explain the principle of the SNN model. Benchmark data sets are applied to compare the proposed approach with other approaches. As there are very efficient learning rules in the SNN model, the model can be applied not only for fusion of multi-sensory data, but also for data mining in large databases with large numbers of attributes.},

Different from the usual firing rules in SNP systems, the firing condition of an inhibitory rule not only depends on the state of the neuron associated with the rule but also is related to the states of other neurons. Moreover, from the perspective of topological structure, the new variant is shown as a directed graph with inhibitory arcs, and therefore seems to have more powerful control. The computational completeness of SNP-IR systems is discussed. In particular, it is proved that SNP-IR systems are Turing universal number accepting/generating devices.

Inspired by this biological phenomenon, spiking neural P systems, i.e. SN P systems, with astrocyte-like control were proposed and were proven to have “Turing completeness” as computing models. In this work, the application of such systems for creating logical operators is investigated. Specifically, it is obtained in a constructive way that SN P systems with astrocyte-like control can synthesize the operations of Boolean logic gates, i.e. AND, OR, NOT, NOR, XOR and NAND gates. The resulting systems are simple and homogeneous, which means only one type of neuron with a unique spiking rule is used. With these neural-like logic gates, more complex Boolean circuits with cascade connections can be constructed. As such, they can be used to implement finite computing devices, such as the finite transducers. These results demonstrate a novel method of constructing logic circuits that work in a neural-like manner, as well as shed some lights on potential directions of designing neural circuits theoretically.},

We prove that SNP-AU systems can generate Turing-computable numbers, through the simulation of the modules of universal register machines. This result improves significantly the results given by classical SN P systems in terms of the number of neurons and rules, while preserving simplicity and power to a reasonable extent. Moreover, we construct an SNP-AU system using 53 neurons, proving its universality for computing functions. Finally, going beyond the design of the building blocks of register machines, a whole universal machine is provided. Thus, a simulator is developed and used to check the correctness of two universal SNP-AU systems proposed in this paper, complementing the theoretical proof with the experimental validation of our systems with respect to the reference example appearing in the foundational paper of small register machines.},

To facilitate learning in such networks, new learning algorithms based on varying degrees of biological plausibility have also been developed recently. Addition of the temporal dimension for information encoding in SNNs yields new insight into the dynamics of the human brain and could result in compact representations of large neural networks.

	abstract = {A capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or an object part. We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

	abstract = {In any information system, the reducts are useful in classifying data. Janusz Starzyk developed an algorithm for computing reducts using strong equivalence and the law of expansion on the data. However, implementation of this algorithm is cumbersome for huge volume of data. This paper deals with a technique for obtaining the reduct of the entire system by partitioning it into two with respect to records and obtaining the reducts of the two subsystems and the 'between reducts'. Further, it also deals with a technique for combining the reducts computed at the clients to obtain global reducts. Moreover, for the huge volume of data, computation of the reduct is NP-hard. Hence, in this paper, the system is subdivided into two subsystems with respect to records and the reducts of each subsystem and the 'relational reduct' are found. Using them, in section VIII, we modify the reduct generation algorithm to compute the reduct of the entire system. First, we shall discuss the elimination method, which is useful in finding the reducts. In this method it is necessary to check all possible combination of data to find the reduct. Hence it is effective only in a system with limited number of records and attributes},

	abstract = {The notion of fuzzy is context dependent, so for each context very often there is a fuzzy theory. Present papers use the notion of neighborhood systems to unify them. A neighborhood system is an association that assigns to each datum a list of data (a neighborhood). Rough sets and topological spaces are special cases. A "real world" fuzzy set should allow small amount of perturbation, so it should have an elastic membership function. Mathematically, such an elastic membership function can be expressed by a highly structured subset of membership function space. Structured sets can be singletons, equivalence classes, neighborhoods, or their fuzzified versions. This paper proposed that fuzzy sets should be abstractly defined by such structures and are termed soft sets (sofsets). Based on such structures, W-sofset, F-sofset, P-sofset, B-sofset, C-sofset, N-sofset, FP-sofset, and FF-sofsets have been identified. In this sequence, a predecessor is always a special case of a successor. Each type represents some implicit form of classical fuzzy theory. It is hoped that such a unified view will provide a useful set theory for soft computing.},

In this paper, we argue that fuzzy techniques are a proper way to this explainability, and we also analyze which fuzzy techniques are most appropriate for this purpose.

	abstract = {Deep learning is increasingly used in decision-making tasks. However, understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions for images often focuses on explaining predictions for single images or neurons. As predictions are often computed from millions of weights that are optimized over millions of images, such explanations can easily miss a bigger picture. We present Summit, an interactive system that scalably and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Summit introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. Summit combines these techniques to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes. Summit scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where Summit helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a prevalent, large-scale image classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network architecture design. The Summit visualization runs in modern web browsers and is open-sourced.},

	abstract = {Linguistic fuzzy modelling, developed by linguistic fuzzy rule-based systems, allows us to deal with the modelling of systems by building a linguistic model which could become interpretable by human beings. Linguistic fuzzy modelling comes with two contradictory requirements: interpretability and accuracy. In recent years the interest of researchers in obtaining more interpretable linguistic fuzzy models has grown. Whereas the measures of accuracy are straightforward and well-known, interpretability measures are difficult to define since interpretability depends on several factors; mainly the model structure, the number of rules, the number of features, the number of linguistic terms, the shape of the fuzzy sets, etc. Moreover, due to the subjectivity of the concept the choice of appropriate interpretability measures is still an open problem. In this paper, we present an overview of the proposed interpretability measures and techniques for obtaining more interpretable linguistic fuzzy rule-based systems. To this end, we will propose a taxonomy based on a double axis: “Complexity versus semantic interpretability” considering the two main kinds of measures; and “rule base versus fuzzy partitions” considering the different components of the knowledge base to which both kinds of measures can be applied. The main aim is to provide a well established framework in order to facilitate a better understanding of the topic and well founded future works.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical fuzzy systems (HFSs) have been shown to have the potential to improve interpretability of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs). In recent years, a variety of indices have been proposed to measure the interpretability of FLSs such as the Nauck index and Fuzzy index. However, interpretability indices associated with HFSs have not so far been discussed. The structure of HFSs, with multiple layers, subsystems, and varied topologies, is the main challenge in constructing interpretability indices for HFSs. Thus, the comparison of interpretability between FLSs and HFSs-even at the index level-is still subject to open discussion. This paper begins to address these challenges by introducing extensions to the FLS Nauck and Fuzzy interpretability indices for HFSs. Using the proposed indices, we explore the concept of interpretability in relation to the different structures in FLSs and HFSs. Initial experiments on benchmark datasets show that based on the proposed indices, HFSs with equivalent function to FLSs produce higher indices, i.e. are more interpretable than their corresponding FLSs.},

In this study, the information theoretical analysis is used to investigate the behavior of layer-wise neurons in deep neural networks. The activation patterns of individual neurons in fully connected layers can provide insights for the performance of the neural network model. The behavior of neuron activation is investigated based on state-of-art classification network model. We study and compare the layer-wise pattern of neurons activation in fully connected layers given the same image input. Experiments are conducted on various data sets. We find that in a well trained classification model, the randomness level of the neurons activation pattern is reduced with the depth of the fully connected layers. This means that the neuron activation patterns of deep layers is more stable than that of shallow layers. The results in this study can also answer the question of how many layers are needed to avoid overfitting in deep neural networks. Corresponding experiments are conducted to validate the assumptions.},

Along similar lines, an Explainable Fuzzy AI Challenge (XFC 2022) competition was launched, whose principal objective was to develop a fully autonomous and optimized XAI algorithm that could play the Python arcade game “Asteroid Smasher”. This research first investigates inference models to implement an efficient (XAI) agent using rule-based fuzzy systems. We also discuss the proposed approach (which won the competition) to attain efficiency in the XAI algorithm. We have explored the potential of the widely used Mamdani- and TSK-based fuzzy inference systems and investigated which model might have a more optimized implementation. Even though the TSK-based model outperforms Mamdani in several applications, no empirical evidence suggests this will also be applicable in implementing an XAI agent. The experimentations are then performed to find a better-performing inference system in a fast-paced environment. The thorough analysis recommends more robust and efficient TSK-based XAI agents than Mamdani-based fuzzy inference systems.},

Thanks to this hybridization, superb abilities are provided to fuzzy modeling in many different data science scenarios. This contribution is intended to comprise a position paper developing a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary fuzzy systems research ﬁeld. To this end, the “4 W” questions are posed and addressed with the aim of understanding the current context of this topic and its signiﬁcance. Speciﬁcally, it will be pointed out why evolutionary fuzzy systems are important from an explainable point of view, when they began, what they are used for, and where the attention of researchers should be directed to in the near future in this area. They must play an important role for the emerging area of eXplainable Artiﬁcial Inteligence (XAI) learning from data.},

	abstract = {In the last years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of AI techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI. Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. This overview examines the existing literature in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. We summarize previous efforts to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition that covers prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which explainability is sought. We then propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at Deep Learning methods for which a second taxonomy is built. This literature analysis serves as the background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the crossroads between data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to XAI with a reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

	abstract = {In the present paper we present the potential of Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods for decision-support in medical image analysis scenarios. With three types of explainable methods applied to the same medical image data set our aim was to improve the comprehensibility of the decisions provided by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The visual explanations were provided on in-vivo gastral images obtained from a Video capsule endoscopy (VCE), with the goal of increasing the health professionals' trust in the black box predictions. We implemented two post-hoc interpretable machine learning methods LIME and SHAP and the alternative explanation approach CIU, centered on the Contextual Value and Utility (CIU). The produced explanations were evaluated using human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on the explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical backgrounds carried out a series of tests in the web-based survey setting and stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user groups (n=20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were quantitatively analyzed. We have found that, as hypothesized, the CIU explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of increasing support for human decision-making as well as being more transparent and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable methods that can with future improvements in implementation be generalized on different medical data sets and can provide great decision-support for medical experts.},

Current approaches of RL need extensive experience to deliver good performance, something that is not acceptable in many real systems when no simulation environment or considerable previous data are available. In Tutor4RL, external knowledge– such as expert or domain knowledge– is expressed as programmable functions that are fed to the RL agent. During its first steps, the agent uses these knowledge functions to decide the best action, guiding its exploration and providing better performance from the start. As the agent gathers experience, it increasingly exploits its learned policy, eventually leaving its tutor behind. We demonstrate Tutor4RL with a DQN agent. In our tests, Tutor4RL achieves more than 3 times higher reward in the beginning of its training than an agent with no external knowledge.},

It is significant and feasible to utilize the big data to make better decisions by machine learning techniques. In this paper, we focus on batch reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) with large discrete or continuous state spaces, aiming to learn the best possible policy given a fixed amount of training data. The batch RL algorithms with handcrafted feature representations work well for low-dimensional MDPs. However, for many real-world RL tasks which often involve high-dimensional state spaces, it is difficult and even infeasible to use feature engineering methods to design features for value function approximation. To cope with high-dimensional RL problems, the desire to obtain data-driven features has led to a lot of works in incorporating feature selection and feature learning into traditional batch RL algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on automatic feature selection and unsupervised feature learning for high-dimensional batch RL. Moreover, we present recent theoretical developments on applying statistical learning to establish finite-sample error bounds for batch RL algorithms based on weighted Lpnorms. Finally, we derive some future directions in the research of RL algorithms, theories and applications.},

The task is to balance a pole that is hinged to a movable cart by applying forces to the cart's base. It is argued that the learning problems faced by adaptive elements that are components of adaptive networks are at least as difficult as this version of the pole-balancing problem. The learning system consists of a single associative search element (ASE) and a single adaptive critic element (ACE). In the course of learning to balance the pole, the ASE constructs associations between input and output by searching under the influence of reinforcement feedback, and the ACE constructs a more informative evaluation function than reinforcement feedback alone can provide. The differences between this approach and other attempts to solve problems using neurolike elements are discussed, as is the relation of this work to classical and instrumental conditioning in animal learning studies and its possible implications for research in the neurosciences.},

However, along with technological developments, the various fields of data and the variety of users are one of the focuses that must be considered in the development of D2T. This study aims to develop a D2T system with input in the form of general data so that it can receive data from any field or domain, whether the data have header information, data types, rules or not. Then fuzzy rule based systems are used to interpret data in general. The system developed can produce information in the form of data summaries, newest data information, and predictive information. It is carried out in the R programming language by utilizing several available packages. Experiments are carried out by measuring the level of readability of the news generated, computation time, and comparing the results with related research. The experimental results show that the information generated is proven to represent the data provided and can be understood by the level of students even at the elementary school level, and the computation time is quite good.},

	abstract = {The success of Deep Learning has created a surge in interest in a wide a range of Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. Deep Learning has not only pushed the state of the art in several existing NLG tasks but has also facilitated researchers to explore various newer NLG tasks such as image captioning. Such rapid progress in NLG has necessitated the development of accurate automatic evaluation metrics that would allow us to track the progress in the field of NLG. However, unlike classification tasks, automatically evaluating NLG systems in itself is a huge challenge. Several works have shown that early heuristic-based metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE are inadequate for capturing the nuances in the different NLG tasks. The expanding number of NLG models and the shortcomings of the current metrics has led to a rapid surge in the number of evaluation metrics proposed since 2014. Moreover, various evaluation metrics have shifted from using pre-determined heuristic-based formulae to trained transformer models. This rapid change in a relatively short time has led to the need for a survey of the existing NLG metrics to help existing and new researchers to quickly come up to speed with the developments that have happened in NLG evaluation in the last few years. Through this survey, we first wish to highlight the challenges and difficulties in automatically evaluating NLG systems. Then, we provide a coherent taxonomy of the evaluation metrics to organize the existing metrics and to better understand the developments in the field. We also describe the different metrics in detail and highlight their key contributions. Later, we discuss the main shortcomings identified in the existing metrics and describe the methodology used to evaluate evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss our suggestions and recommendations on the next steps forward to improve the automatic evaluation metrics.},

In this paper, we introduce a framework to represent and reason with temporal uncertainty based on possibility theory and propose a model that uses the outcomes of such temporal reasoning to select linguistic expressions to convey uncertainty to the reader. Our model is based on Fuzzy Temporal Constraint Networks (FTCN) and our work is based on the assumption that uncertainty should be communicated to an end user. The model we propose is grounded in experimental data from three languages. We present a large-scale empirical study that investigates the conditions that influence human subjective uncertainty in reasoning about temporal relations. Based on this, we also construct a classifier to select expressions to convey uncertainty, based on possibility and necessity values. We then present an evaluation which shows that the predictions of the FTCN model correlate well with human subjective uncertainty in different scenarios. An evaluation of our temporal expressions classifier also suggests good results, compared to human selection of linguistic expressions, as compared to baseline models.},

However, there is no proper exposure and recognition in other areas to which CWW belongs and can really contribute, notably natural-language processing (NLP), in general, and natural-language understanding (NLU) and natural-language generation (NLG), in particular. First, we present crucial elements of CWW, in particular Zadeh's protoforms, and indicate their power and stress a need to develop new tools to handle more modalities. We argue that CWW also has a high implementation potential and present our approach to linguistic data(base) summaries, which is a very intuitive and human-consistent natural-language-based knowledge-discovery tool. Special emphasis is on the use of Zadeh's protoform (prototypical form) as a general form of a linguistic data summary. We present an extension of our interactive approach, which is based on fuzzy logic and fuzzy database queries, to implement such linguistic summaries. In the main part of the paper, we discuss a close relation between linguistic summarization in the sense considered and some basic ideas and solutions in NLG, thus analyzing possible common elements and an opportunity to use developed tools, as well as some inherent differences and difficulties. Notably, we indicate a close relation of linguistic summaries that are considered to be some type of an extended template-based, and even a simple phrase-based, NLG system and emphasize a possibility to use software that is available in these areas. An important conclusion is also an urgent need to develop new protoforms, thus going beyond the classical ones of Zadeh. For illustration, we present an implementation for a sales database in a computer retailer, thereby showing the power of linguistic summaries, as well as an urgent need for new types of protoforms. Although we use linguistic summaries throughout, our discussion is also valid for CWW in general. We hope that this paper—which presents our personal view and perspective that result from our long-time involvement in both theoretical work in broadly perceived CWW and real-world implementations—will trigger a discussion and research efforts to help find a way out of a strange situation in which, on one hand, one can clearly see that CWW is related to words (language) and computing and, hence, should be part of broadly perceived mainstream computational linguistics, which lack tools to handle imprecision. These tools can be provided by CWW. Yet, CWW is practically unknown to these communities and is not mentioned or cited, and—reciprocally—even the top people in CWW do not refer to the results that are obtained in these areas. We hope that our paper, for the benefit of both the areas, will help bridge this gap that results from a wrong and dangerous fragmentation of{\textbackslash}break science.},

The computational power of such P systems is studied. Specifically, it is proved that such P systems with one cell and using evolutional symport rules of length at most 3 or using evolutional antiport rules of length at most 4 are Turing universal (only the family of all finite sets of positive integers can be generated by such P systems if standard symport/antiport rules are used). Moreover, cell division rules are considered in tissue P systems with evolutional symport/antiport rules, and a limit on the efficiency of such P systems is provided with evolutional communication rules of length at most 2. The computational efficiency of this kind of models is shown when using evolutional communication rules of length at most 4.},

The new algorithm is tested on a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, the travelling salesman problem. The empirical evidence suggests that the proposed approach is efficient and reliable when dealing with 11 benchmark instances, particularly obtaining the best of the known solutions in eight instances.

Therefore, it is often difficult to explain the physical meaning behind the embedding dimensions. In this research, we propose the interpretable kernel DR algorithm (I-KDR) as a new algorithm which maps the data from the feature space to a lower dimensional space where the classes are more condensed with less overlapping. Besides, the algorithm creates the dimensions upon local contributions of the data samples, which makes it easier to interpret them by class labels. Additionally, we efficiently fuse the DR with feature selection task to select the most relevant features of the original space to the discriminative objective. Based on the empirical evidence, I-KDR provides better interpretations for embedding dimensions as well as higher discriminative performance in the embedded space compared to the state-of-the-art and popular DR algorithms.},

	abstract = {As energy demand continues to increase, demand response (DR) programs in the electricity distribution grid are gaining momentum and their adoption is set to grow gradually over the years ahead. Demand response schemes seek to incentivise consumers to use green energy and reduce their electricity usage during peak periods which helps support grid balancing of supply-demand and generate revenue by selling surplus of energy back to the grid. This paper proposes an effective energy management system for residential demand response using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Fuzzy Reasoning (FR). RL is considered as a model-free control strategy which learns from the interaction with its environment by performing actions and evaluating the results. The proposed algorithm considers human preference by directly integrating user feedback into its control logic using fuzzy reasoning as reward functions. Q-learning, a RL strategy based on a reward mechanism, is used to make optimal decisions to schedule the operation of smart home appliances by shifting controllable appliances from peak periods, when electricity prices are high, to off-peak hours, when electricity prices are lower without affecting the customer's preferences. The proposed approach works with a single agent to control 14 household appliances and uses a reduced number of state-action pairs and fuzzy logic for rewards functions to evaluate an action taken for a certain state. The simulation results show that the proposed appliances scheduling approach can smooth the power consumption profile and minimise the electricity cost while considering user's preferences, user's feedbacks on each action taken and his/her preference settings. A user-interface is developed in MATLAB/Simulink for the Home Energy Management System (HEMS) to demonstrate the proposed DR scheme. The simulation tool includes features such as smart appliances, electricity pricing signals, smart meters, solar photovoltaic generation, battery energy storage, electric vehicle and grid supply.},

Many prediction models are used to predict WS for which wind is non-stationary, nonlinear and irregular. However, they neglect the effectiveness of feature selection methods in WS prediction, thereby creating very challenging for precise prediction of WS and safe operation of the wind industry. To overpower these challenges and further improve WS prediction accuracy, a prediction model is developed based on feature selection technique and prediction models. Therefore this study proposes an adaptive self-learning wind speed (WS) predicting model using fuzzy reinforcement learning (FRL) that is Fuzzy Q Learning (FQL). Proposed FQL based WS predictor model can predict with great accuracy. This is a first effort at developing a forecasting model using FRL for WS prediction. The presented model has no prior knowledge of the system or plant or target speed information. Measured WS is processed through Info Gain attribute evaluator with Ranker search method feature selection purpose which serves as input to the FQL based WS prediction model. The comparison of proposed prediction method and existing machine learning based is carried out using simulations. The performance analysis indicates that the proposed method serves as an important tool for wind potential assessment.},

Herein, an attempt has been made to design an adaptive, intelligent transformer fault classifier that progressively learns to identify faults on-line with high accuracy for all fault types. In the proposed approach, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data of oil samples collected from real power transformers (and from credible sources) has been used, which serves as input to a fuzzy RL based classifier. Typically, classification accuracy is heavily dependent on the number of input variables chosen. This has been resolved by using the J48 algorithm to select 8 most appropriate input variables from the 24 variables obtained using DGA. Proposed fuzzy RL approach achieves a fault identification accuracy of 99.7\%, which is significantly higher than other contemporary soft computing based identifiers. Experimental results and comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, highlights superiority and efficacy of the proposed fuzzy RL technique for transformer fault classification.},

This usually necessitates different control approaches to tackle various objectives, such as guidance, collision avoidance, and cohesion. The guidance schemes, in particular, have long suffered from complex tracking-error dynamics. Furthermore, techniques that are based on linear feedback strategies obtained at equilibrium conditions either may not hold or degrade when applied to uncertain dynamic environments. Pre-tuned fuzzy inference architectures lack robustness under such unmodeled conditions. This work introduces an adaptive distributed technique for the autonomous control of flock systems. Its relatively flexible structure is based on online fuzzy reinforcement learning schemes which simultaneously target a number of objectives; namely, following a leader, avoiding collision, and reaching a flock velocity consensus. In addition to its resilience in the face of dynamic disturbances, the algorithm does not require more than the agent position as a feedback signal. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with two simulation scenarios and benchmarked against a similar technique from the literature.},

In this paper, we propose a novel RL approach to combine the universal-function-approximation capability of fuzzy systems with consideration of probability distributions over possible consequences of an action. The proposed generalized probabilistic fuzzy RL (GPFRL) method is a modified version of the actor-critic (AC) learning architecture. The learning is enhanced by the introduction of a probability measure into the learning structure, where an incremental gradient-descent weight-updating algorithm provides convergence.

	abstract = {In general, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is characterized by its learning algorithm and its linguistic knowledge representation. However, it does not necessarily interact with its environment when the training data is assumed to be an accurate description of the environment under consideration. In interactive problems, it would be more appropriate for an agent to learn from its own experience through interactions with the environment, i.e., reinforcement learning. In this paper, three clustering algorithms are developed based on the reinforcement learning paradigm. This allows a more accurate description of the clusters as the clustering process is influenced by the reinforcement signal. They are the REINFORCE clustering technique I (RCT-I), the REINFORCE clustering technique II (RCT-II), and the episodic REINFORCE clustering technique (ERCT). The integrations of the RCT-I, the RCT-II, and the ERCT within the pseudo-outer product truth value restriction (POPTVR), which is a fuzzy neural network integrated with the truth restriction value (TVR) inference scheme in its five layered feedforward neural network, form the RPOPTVR-I, the RPOPTVR-II, and the ERPOPTVR, respectively. The Iris, Phoneme, and Spiral data sets are used for benchmarking. For both Iris and Phoneme data, the RPOPTVR is able to yield better classification results which are higher than the original POPTVR and the modified POPTVR over the three test trials. For the Spiral data set, the RPOPTVR-II is able to outperform the others by at least a margin of 5.8\% over multiple test trials. The three reinforcement-based clustering techniques applied to the POPTVR network are able to exhibit the trial-and-error search characteristic that yields higher qualitative performance.},

Self-optimization of coverage and capacity, which allows the system to periodically and automatically adjust the key radio frequency (RF) parameters through intelligent algorithms, is one of the most important tasks in the context of self-organizing networks (SON). In this paper, we propose self-optimization of antenna tilt and power using a fuzzy neural network optimization based on reinforcement learning (RL-FNN). In our approach, a central control mechanism enables cooperation-based learning by allowing distributed SON entities to share their optimization experience, represented as the parameters of learning method. Specifically, SON entities use cooperative Q-learning and reinforced back-propagation method to acquire and adjust their optimization experience. To evaluate the coverage and capacity performance of RL-FNN, we analyze cell-edge performance and cell-center performance indicators jointly across neighboring cells and specifically consider the difference in load distribution in a given region. The simulation results show that RL-FNN performs significantly better than the best fixed configuration proposed in the literature. Furthermore, this is achieved with significantly lower energy consumption. Finally, since each self-optimization round completes in less than a minute, RL-FNN can meet the need of practical applications of self-optimization in a dynamic environment.},

It provides alternative solutions to common problems in RL, like function approximation and continuous action space. The learning process resembles that of human beings by clustering the encountered states, developing experiences for each of the typical cases, and making decisions fuzzily. The learned policy can be expressed as human-intelligible IF-THEN rules, which facilitates further investigation and improvement. It adopts the actor–critic architecture whereas being different from mainstream policy gradient methods. The value function is approximated through the fuzzy system AnYa. The state–action space is discretized into a static grid with nodes. Each node is treated as one prototype and corresponds to one fuzzy rule, with the value of the node being the consequent. Values of consequents are updated using the Sarsa(λ) algorithm. Probability distribution of optimal actions regarding different states is estimated through Empirical Data Analytics (EDA), Autonomous Learning Multi-Model Systems (ALMMo), and Empirical Fuzzy Sets (εFS). The fuzzy kernel of IFRL avoids the lack of interpretability in other methods based on neural networks. Simulation results with four problems, namely Mountain Car, Continuous Gridworld, Pendulum Position, and Tank Level Control, are presented as a proof of the proposed concept.},

The essential operation of cluster heads (CHs) in such a network is to transmit the aggregated data to the sink node through multi-hop communication, thus the energy to be used in a better way during the period of aggregation and transmission. Therefore, this study presents a scheme based on grid clustering and fuzzy reinforcement-learning to maximise network lifetime as well as energy-efficient data aggregation for distributed WSN. Initially, grid clustering is employed for cluster formation and CH selection. Further, a fuzzy rule system-based reinforcement learning algorithm is used to select the data aggregator node based on the parameters, such as distance, neighbourhood overlap, and algebraic connectivity. Finally, the dynamic relocation of the mobile sink is performed within a grid-based clustered network region using a fruit fly optimisation algorithm. The experimental outcomes revealed that the proposed data aggregation scheme provides superior performance in terms of energy consumption and network lifetime compared to earlier systems.},

	abstract = {Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) has been envisioned as a potential fog computing paradigm which aims to offload delay sensitive tasks to mobile fog vehicles instead of remote cloud in order to facilitate computational demands of smart villages close to rural highways. There exists challenges related to task offloading in VFC that need to be addressed. Most often, Road Side Units (RSUs) deployed along rural highways are energy constrained and they need to provide energy efficient scheduling services for the allocation of tasks to fog vehicles. On the other hand, energy consumption optimization is challenging, since scheduling decision of local processing of tasks incur computation cost while the allocation of tasks to fog vehicles incurs communication cost. Although the task offloading to VFC reduces response latency, it leads to higher RSU energy consumption contributed by the communication of task data to fog vehicles. Therefore, this paper presents an energy efficient vehicle scheduling problem for offloading of tasks to mobile fog nodes subject to satisfy constraints of task deadline and resource availability. To resolve high dimensionality issue caused by increased number of vehicles in RSU coverage, we propose an on-policy reinforcement leaning based scheduling algorithm combined with fuzzy logic based greedy heuristic, named as Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning (FRL). This greedy heuristic not only accelerates learning process, but also improves long term reward when compared to Q-learning algorithm. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate the proposed algorithm and the simulation results show that the proposed FRL algorithm outperforms other scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS), Fuzzy and Distributed Task Allocation with Distributed Process (DTA\_DP).},

In the paper, they are used to tune online the conclusion part of fuzzy inference systems (FIS). The only information available for learning is the system feedback, which describes in terms of reward and punishment the task the fuzzy agent has to realize. At each time step, the agent receives a reinforcement signal according to the last action it has performed in the previous state. The problem involves optimizing not only the direct reinforcement, but also the total amount of reinforcements the agent can receive in the future. To illustrate the use of these two learning methods, we first applied them to a problem that involves finding a fuzzy controller to drive a boat from one bank to another, across a river with a strong nonlinear current. Then, we used the well known Cart-Pole Balancing and Mountain-Car problems to be able to compare our methods to other reinforcement learning methods and focus on important characteristic aspects of FACL and FQL. We found that the genericity of our methods allows us to learn every kind of reinforcement learning problem (continuous states, discrete/continuous actions, various type of reinforcement functions). The experimental studies also show the superiority of these methods with respect to the other related methods we can find in the literature.},

	abstract = {Test automation brings the potential to reduce costs and human effort, but several aspects of software testing remain challenging to automate. One such example is automated performance testing to find performance breaking points. Current approaches to tackle automated generation of performance test cases mainly involve using source code or system model analysis or use-case-based techniques. However, source code and system models might not always be available at testing time. On the other hand, if the optimal performance testing policy for the intended objective in a testing process instead could be learned by the testing system, then test automation without advanced performance models could be possible. Furthermore, the learned policy could later be reused for similar software systems under test, thus leading to higher test efficiency. We propose SaFReL, a self-adaptive fuzzy reinforcement learning-based performance testing framework. SaFReL learns the optimal policy to generate performance test cases through an initial learning phase, then reuses it during a transfer learning phase, while keeping the learning running and updating the policy in the long term. Through multiple experiments in a simulated performance testing setup, we demonstrate that our approach generates the target performance test cases for different programs more efficiently than a typical testing process and performs adaptively without access to source code and performance models.},

In this study, a hybrid power system with the application of the Tidal Power Unit (TPU) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) is effectively planed as an isolated MG. A new fractional gradient descent (FGD) based on a single-input interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (SIT2-FLC) is suggested as the main LFC controller, where the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) coefficient of the SIT2-FLC is specifically adjusted to enhance the LFC performance. Additionally, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) with the actor-critic framework is considered to generate the supplementary control action, which is useful for the frequency stabilization by adapting to the randomness of load disturbances and RESs.

Therefore, the quality of trajectory tracking for continuum robots plays an essential role in the success of the application procedures. While there are a few different actuation configurations available for CRs, the focus of this paper will be placed on tendon-driven manipulators.

	abstract = {Fuzzy logic systems are promising for efficient obstacle avoidance. However, it is difficult to maintain the correctness, consistency, and completeness of a fuzzy rule base constructed and tuned by a human expert. A reinforcement learning method is capable of learning the fuzzy rules automatically. However, it incurs a heavy learning phase and may result in an insufficiently learned rule base due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a neural fuzzy system with mixed coarse learning and fine learning phases. In the first phase, a supervised learning method is used to determine the membership functions for input and output variables simultaneously. After sufficient training, fine learning is applied which employs reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the membership functions for output variables. For sufficient learning, a new learning method using a modification of Sutton and Barto's model is proposed to strengthen the exploration. Through this two-step tuning approach, the mobile robot is able to perform collision-free navigation. To deal with the difficulty of acquiring a large amount of training data with high consistency for supervised learning, we develop a virtual environment (VE) simulator, which is able to provide desktop virtual environment (DVE) and immersive virtual environment (IVE) visualization. Through operating a mobile robot in the virtual environment (DVE/IVE) by a skilled human operator, training data are readily obtained and used to train the neural fuzzy system.},

The authors then propose an online supervised structure/parameter learning algorithm for constructing the NN-FLCS dynamically. This algorithm combines the backpropagation learning scheme for the parameter learning and a fuzzy similarity measure for the structure learning. The proposed online structure/parameter learning algorithm can find proper fuzzy logic rules, membership functions, and the size of output fuzzy partitions simultaneously. Computer simulation examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the learning algorithms.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

This paper studies offline RL using the DQN Replay Dataset comprising the entire replay experience of a DQN agent on 60 Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that recent off-policy deep RL algorithms, even when trained solely on this fixed dataset, outperform the fully-trained DQN agent. To enhance generalization in the offline setting, we present Random Ensemble Mixture (REM), a robust Q-learning algorithm that enforces optimal Bellman consistency on random convex combinations of multiple Q-value estimates. Offline REM trained on the DQN Replay Dataset surpasses strong RL baselines. Ablation studies highlight the role of offline dataset size and diversity as well as the algorithm choice in our positive results. Overall, the results here present an optimistic view that robust RL algorithms used on sufficiently large and diverse offline datasets can lead to high quality policies. To provide a testbed for offline RL and reproduce our results, the DQN Replay Dataset is released at offline-rl.github.io.},

When sampled probabilistically, these state transitions, rewards, and actions can all induce randomness in the observed long-term return. Traditionally, reinforcement learning algorithms average over this randomness to estimate the value function. In this paper, we build on recent work advocating a distributional approach to reinforcement learning in which the distribution over returns is modeled explicitly instead of only estimating the mean. That is, we examine methods of learning the value distribution instead of the value function. We give results that close a number of gaps between the theoretical and algorithmic results given by Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos (2017). First, we extend existing results to the approximate distribution setting. Second, we present a novel distributional reinforcement learning algorithm consistent with our theoretical formulation.

abstract = {“Is there a need for fuzzy logic?” is an issue which is associated with a long history of spirited discussions and debate. There are many misconceptions about fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is not fuzzy. Basically, fuzzy logic is a precise logic of imprecision and approximate reasoning. More specifically, fuzzy logic may be viewed as an attempt at formalization/mechanization of two remarkable human capabilities. First, the capability to converse, reason and make rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty, incompleteness of information, conflicting information, partiality of truth and partiality of possibility – in short, in an environment of imperfect information. And second, the capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations [L.A. Zadeh, From computing with numbers to computing with words – from manipulation of measurements to manipulation of perceptions, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems 45 (1999) 105–119; L.A. Zadeh, A new direction in AI – toward a computational theory of perceptions, AI Magazine 22 (1) (2001) 73–84]. In fact, one of the principal contributions of fuzzy logic – a contribution which is widely unrecognized – is its high power of precisiation. Fuzzy logic is much more than a logical system. It has many facets. The principal facets are: logical, fuzzy-set-theoretic, epistemic and relational. Most of the practical applications of fuzzy logic are associated with its relational facet. In this paper, fuzzy logic is viewed in a nonstandard perspective. In this perspective, the cornerstones of fuzzy logic – and its principal distinguishing features – are: graduation, granulation, precisiation and the concept of a generalized constraint. A concept which has a position of centrality in the nontraditional view of fuzzy logic is that of precisiation. Informally, precisiation is an operation which transforms an object, p, into an object, p∗, which in some specified sense is defined more precisely than p. The object of precisiation and the result of precisiation are referred to as precisiend and precisiand, respectively. In fuzzy logic, a differentiation is made between two meanings of precision – precision of value, v-precision, and precision of meaning, m-precision. Furthermore, in the case of m-precisiation a differentiation is made between mh-precisiation, which is human-oriented (nonmathematical), and mm-precisiation, which is machine-oriented (mathematical). A dictionary definition is a form of mh-precisiation, with the definiens and definiendum playing the roles of precisiend and precisiand, respectively. Cointension is a qualitative measure of the proximity of meanings of the precisiend and precisiand. A precisiand is cointensive if its meaning is close to the meaning of the precisiend. A concept which plays a key role in the nontraditional view of fuzzy logic is that of a generalized constraint. If X is a variable then a generalized constraint on X, GC(X), is expressed as X isr R, where R is the constraining relation and r is an indexical variable which defines the modality of the constraint, that is, its semantics. The primary constraints are: possibilistic, (r=blank), probabilistic (r=p) and veristic (r=v). The standard constraints are: bivalent possibilistic, probabilistic and bivalent veristic. In large measure, science is based on standard constraints. Generalized constraints may be combined, qualified, projected, propagated and counterpropagated. The set of all generalized constraints, together with the rules which govern generation of generalized constraints, is referred to as the generalized constraint language, GCL. The standard constraint language, SCL, is a subset of GCL. In fuzzy logic, propositions, predicates and other semantic entities are precisiated through translation into GCL. Equivalently, a semantic entity, p, may be precisiated by representing its meaning as a generalized constraint. By construction, fuzzy logic has a much higher level of generality than bivalent logic. It is the generality of fuzzy logic that underlies much of what fuzzy logic has to offer. Among the important contributions of fuzzy logic are the following: 1.FL-generalization. Any bivalent-logic-based theory, T, may be FL-generalized, and hence upgraded, through addition to T of concepts and techniques drawn from fuzzy logic. Examples: fuzzy control, fuzzy linear programming, fuzzy probability theory and fuzzy topology.2.Linguistic variables and fuzzy if–then rules. The formalism of linguistic variables and fuzzy if–then rules is, in effect, a powerful modeling language which is widely used in applications of fuzzy logic. Basically, the formalism serves as a means of summarization and information compression through the use of granulation.3.Cointensive precisiation. Fuzzy logic has a high power of cointensive precisiation. This power is needed for a formulation of cointensive definitions of scientific concepts and cointensive formalization of human-centric fields such as economics, linguistics, law, conflict resolution, psychology and medicine.4.NL-Computation (computing with words). Fuzzy logic serves as a basis for NL-Computation, that is, computation with information described in natural language. NL-Computation is of direct relevance to mechanization of natural language understanding and computation with imprecise probabilities. More generally, NL-Computation is needed for dealing with second-order uncertainty, that is, uncertainty about uncertainty, or uncertainty2 for short. In summary, progression from bivalent logic to fuzzy logic is a significant positive step in the evolution of science. In large measure, the real-world is a fuzzy world. To deal with fuzzy reality what is needed is fuzzy logic. In coming years, fuzzy logic is likely to grow in visibility, importance and acceptance.}

	doi = {10.1109/CACS.2017.8284272},
	abstract = {This paper proposes a fuzzy reinforcement learning technique that enables a group of pursuers in pursuit-evasion (PE) differential games to learn how to capture a single superior evader in a decentralized manner. The superiority of the evader is in term of its maximum speed which means that this speed exceeds the maximum speed of the fastest pursuer in the game. The proposed learning technique uses a fuzzy actor-critic learning Automaton (FACLA) algorithm together with the so-called Apollonius circle technique and a specific formation control strategy which are used to define the necessary reward function for each pursuer. This enables each pursuer to update its value function accurately. Accordingly, the pursuer will take the right actions by tuning its fuzzy logic controller (FLC) parameters. The formation control strategy is also used such that during the capturing process the distribution angles of the pursuers around the evader are invariant as much as possible. Furthermore, it is also used to avoid a collision among them. It is assumed that the superior evader is an intelligent evader whose strategy is to continuously search for a gap during the evasion process by using the Apollonius circle method. If there is a gap, the evader will select its path through the gap to escape otherwise the evader will change its direction to increase the capture time. Simulation results are given to validate the proposed learning algorithm.},

We define this as network morphism in this research. After morphing a parent network, the child network is expected to inherit the knowledge from its parent network and also has the potential to continue growing into a more powerful one with much shortened training time. The first requirement for this network morphism is its ability to handle diverse morphing types of networks, including changes of depth, width, kernel size, and even subnet. To meet this requirement, we first introduce the network morphism equations, and then develop novel morphing algorithms for all these morphing types for both classic and convolutional neural networks. The second requirement is its ability to deal with non-linearity in a network. We propose a family of parametric-activation functions to facilitate the morphing of any continuous non-linear activation neurons. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and typical neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network morphism scheme.}

The proposed NFCN is a feedforward multilayered network which integrates the basic elements and functions of a traditional fuzzy logic controller into a connectionist structure which has distributed learning abilities. The NFCN can be constructed from supervised training examples by machine learning techniques, and the connectionist structure can be trained to develop fuzzy logic rules and find membership functions. Associated with the NFCN is a two-phase hybrid learning algorithm which utilizes unsupervised learning schemes for structure learning and the backpropagation learning scheme for parameter learning. By combining both unsupervised and supervised learning schemes, the learning speed converges much faster than the original backpropagation algorithm. The two-phase hybrid learning algorithm requires exact supervised training data for learning. In some real-time applications, exact training data may be expensive or even impossible to obtain. To solve this problem, a reinforcement neural fuzzy control network (RNFCN) is further proposed. The RNFCN is constructed by integrating two NFCNs, one functioning as a fuzzy predictor and the other as a fuzzy controller. By combining a proposed on-line supervised structure-parameter learning technique, the temporal difference prediction method, and the stochastic exploratory algorithm, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, which can construct a RNFCN automatically and dynamically through a reward-penalty signal (i.e., “good” or “bad” signal). Two examples are presented to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed models and learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {Existing neural fuzzy (neuro-fuzzy) networks proposed in the literature can be broadly classified into two groups. The first group is essentially fuzzy systems with self-tuning capabilities and requires an initial rule base to be specified prior to training. The second group of neural fuzzy networks, on the other hand, is able to automatically formulate the fuzzy rules from the numerical training data. No initial rule base needs to be specified prior to training. A cluster analysis is first performed on the training data and the fuzzy rules are subsequently derived through the proper connections of these computed clusters. However, most existing neural fuzzy systems (whether they belong to the first or second group) encountered one or more of the following major problems. They are 1) inconsistent rule-base; 2) heuristically defined node operations; 3) susceptibility to noisy training data and the stability–plasticity dilemma; and 4) needs for prior knowledge such as the number of clusters to be computed. Hence, a novel neural fuzzy system that is immune to the above-mentioned deficiencies is proposed in this paper. This new neural fuzzy system is named the generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network (GenSoFNN). The GenSoFNN network has strong noise tolerance capability by employing a new clustering technique known as discrete incremental clustering (DIC). The fuzzy rule base of the GenSoFNN network is consistent and compact as GenSoFNN has built-in mechanisms to identify and prune redundant and/or obsolete rules. Extensive simulations were conducted using the proposed GenSoFNN network and its performance is encouraging when benchmarked against other neural and neural fuzzy systems.},

	abstract = {System modeling with neuro-fuzzy systems involves two contradictory requirements: interpretability verses accuracy. The pseudo outer-product (POP) rule identification algorithm used in the family of pseudo outer-product-based fuzzy neural networks (POPFNN) suffered from an exponential increase in the number of identified fuzzy rules and computational complexity arising from high-dimensional data. This decreases the interpretability of the POPFNN in linguistic fuzzy modeling. This article proposes a novel rough set-based pseudo outer-product (RSPOP) algorithm that integrates the sound concept of knowledge reduction from rough set theory with the POP algorithm. The proposed algorithm not only performs feature selection through the reduction of attributes but also extends the reduction to rules without redundant attributes. As many possible reducts exist in a given rule set, an objective measure is developed for POPFNN to correctly identify the reducts that improve the inferred consequence. Experimental results are presented using published data sets and real-world application involving highway traffic flow prediction to evaluate the effectiveness of using the proposed algorithm to identify fuzzy rules in the POPFNN using compositional rule of inference and singleton fuzzifier (POPFNN-CRI(S)) architecture. Results showed that the proposed rough set-based pseudo outer-product algorithm reduces computational complexity, improves the interpretability of neuro-fuzzy systems by identifying significantly fewer fuzzy rules, and improves the accuracy of the POPFNN.},

The POP algorithm utilizes a one-pass rule identification and generation process and rough set theory to perform attribute and rule reduction, hence, producing highly interpretable if-then fuzzy rules while maintaining a high level of accuracy. However, non-incremental systems are heavily dependant on the quality and quantity of the training set, an issue especially prominent in time series data. The robustness of RSPOP FNN is improved using an adapted form of discrete incremental clustering (DIC), an incremental learning algorithm. This renders the system immune to deficiencies in the training set. Issues with the incremental rough set attribute reduction are also addressed using an adapted form of Learn++ Non-Stationary Environments (Learn++.NSE), a form of ensemble learning strong in datasets with the concept drift phenomenon. This is often found in time series data. The proposed system has been extensively benchmarked in traffic flow prediction, real life stock price and volatility predictions. The results show the strength of the online systems against offline systems. The promising results demonstrated the benefit of incremental learning in the accuracy and adaptability of its time series prediction ability.},

	abstract = {There are two important issues in neuro-fuzzy modeling: (1) interpretability—the ability to describe the behavior of the system in an interpretable way—and (2) accuracy—the ability to approximate the outcome of the system accurately. As these two objectives usually exert contradictory requirements on the neuro-fuzzy model, certain compromise has to be undertaken. This letter proposes a novel rule reduction algorithm, namely, Hebb rule reduction, and an iterative tuning process to balance interpretability and accuracy. The Hebb rule reduction algorithm uses Hebbian ordering, which represents the degree of coverage of the samples by the rule, as an importance measure of each rule to merge the membership functions and hence reduces the number of the rules. Similar membership functions (MFs) are merged by a specified similarity measure in an order of Hebbian importance, and the resultant equivalent rules are deleted from the rule base. The rule with a higher Hebbian importance will be retained among a set of rules. The MFs are tuned through the least mean square (LMS) algorithm to reduce the modeling error. The tuning of the MFs and the reduction of the rules proceed iteratively to achieve a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Three published data sets by Nakanishi (Nakanishi, Turksen, \&amp; Sugeno, 1993), the Pat synthetic data set (Pal, Mitra, \&amp; Mitra, 2003), and the traffic flow density prediction data set are used as benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Good interpretability, as well as high modeling accuracy, are derivable simultaneously and are suitably benchmarked against other well-established neuro-fuzzy models.},

The main drawback of rule-based system is that it may contain large complex rules for classification and sometimes it becomes very difficult in interpretation. Rule reduction is also difficult for various reasons. Removing important rules may effect in classification accuracy. This paper proposes a hybrid fuzzy-rough set approach named RS-HeRR for the generation of effective, interpretable and compact rule set. It combines a powerful rule generation and reduction fuzzy system, called Hebbian-based rule reduction algorithm (HeRR) and a novel rough-set-based attribute selection algorithm for rule reduction. The proposed hybridization leverages upon rule reduction through reduction in partial dependency as well as improvement in system performance to significantly reduce the problem of redundancy in HeRR, even while providing similar or better accuracy. RS-HeRR demonstrates these characteristics repeatedly over four diverse practical classification problems, such as diabetes identification, urban water treatment monitoring, sonar target classification, and detection of ovarian cancer. It also demonstrates excellent performance for highly biased datasets. In addition, it competes very well with established non-fuzzy classifiers and outperforms state-of-the-art methods that use rough sets for rule reduction in fuzzy systems.},

In this paper, we show that the best rule according to any of these metrics must reside along a support/confidence border. Further, in the case of conjunctive rule mining within categorical data, the number of rules along this border is conveniently small, and can be mined efficiently from a variety of real-world data-sets. We also show how this concept can be generalized to mine all rules that are best according to any of these criteria with respect to an arbitrary subset of the population of interest. We argue that by returning a broader set of rules than previous algorithms, our techniques allow for improved insight into the data and support more user-interaction in the optimized rule-mining process.},

The extreme uncertainty of NL is the major challenge to meet this ambitious goal requiring computational approaches to handle NL uncertainties. Attempts to solve various CWW tasks lead to the methodological questions about rigorous and heuristic formulations and solutions of the CWW tasks. These attempts immediately reincarnated the long-time discussion about different methodologies to model uncertainty, namely: Probability Theory, Multi-valued logic, Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, and the Possibility theory. The main forum of the recent discussion was an on-line Berkeley Initiative on Soft Computing group in 2014. Zadeh claims that some computing with words tasks are in the province of the fuzzy logic and possibility theory, and probabilistic solutions are not appropriate for these tasks. In this work we propose a useful constructive probabilistic approach for CWW based on sets of specialized K-Measure (Kolmogorov’s measure) probability spaces that differs from the random sets. This work clarifies the relationships between probability and possibility theories in the context of CWW.},

With the introduction of fuzzy sets into traditional spatial co-location pattern mining, the research on fuzzy spatial co-location pattern mining has been deepened continuously, which extends traditional spatial co-location pattern mining to deal with fuzzy spatial objects and discover their laws of spatial symbiosis. In this paper, the operation principle of a classical join-based algorithm for mining spatial co-location patterns is briefly described firstly. Then, combining with the definition of classical participation rate and participation degree, a novel hesitant fuzzy spatial co-location pattern mining algorithm is proposed based on the establishment of the hesitant fuzzy participation rate and hesitant fuzzy participation formula according to the characteristics in fusion of hesitant fuzzy set theory, the score function and spatial co-location pattern mining. Finally, the proposed algorithm is written and implemented based on Python language, which uses a NumPy system to the expansion of the open source numerical calculation. The Python program of the proposed algorithm includes the method of computing hesitant fuzzy membership based on score function, the implementation of generating k-order candidate patterns, k-order frequent patterns and k-order table instances. A hesitant fuzzy spatial co-location pattern mining experiment is carried out and the experimental results show that the proposed and implemented algorithm is effective and feasible.},

Rather than requiring that the system be hermetically sealed to avoid perceptions of human influence, developing creative autonomy is argued to be more plausible if the system is intimately embedded in a broader society of other creators and critics. Ideas are presented for constructing systems that might be able to achieve creative autonomy.},

These two objectives are in conflict and constitute an open problem. A new operational framework to form the evolving information granule (EIG) is developed in this paper, which ensures a compromise between interpretability and reasonable accuracy. The evolving information granule is initiated with the first information granule by translating the knowledge of the entire output domain. The initial information granule is considered an underfitting state with a high approximation error. Then, the EIG starts evolving in the information granule by partitioning the output domain and uses a dynamic constraint to maintain semantic interpretability in the output-contexts. The important criterion in the EIG is to determine the prominent distinction (output-context) in the output domain and realize the distinct information granule that depicts the semantics at the fuzzy partition level. The EIG tends to evolve toward the lower error region and realizes the effective rulebase by avoiding overfitting. The outcome on the synthetic and real-world data using the EIG shows the effectiveness of the proposed system, which outperforms state-of-the art methods.},

	abstract = {The requirement to trace and process moving objects in the contemporary era gradually increases since numerous applications quickly demand precise moving object locations. The Map-matching method is employed as a preprocessing technique, which matches a moving object point on a corresponding road. However, most of the GPS trajectory datasets include stay-points irregularity, which makes mapmatching algorithms mismatch trajectories to irrelevant streets. Therefore, determining the stay-point region in GPS trajectory datasets result in better accurate matching and more rapid approaches. In this work, we cluster stay-points in a trajectory dataset with DBSCAN and eliminate redundant data to improve the efficiency of the map-matching algorithm by lowering processing time. We reckoned our proposed method’s performance and exactness with a ground truth dataset compared to a fuzzy-logic based map-matching algorithm. Fortunately, our approach yields 27.39\% data size reduction and 8.9\% processing time reduction with the same accurate results as the previous fuzzy-logic based map-matching approach.},

When the null hypothesis is rejected in a validation, MCTs are performed when certain experimental conditions have a statistically significant mean difference or there is a specific aspect between the group means. A problem occurs if the error rate increases while multiple hypothesis tests are performed simultaneously. Consequently, in an MCT, it is necessary to control the error rate to an appropriate level. In this paper, we discuss how to test multiple hypotheses simultaneously while limiting type I error rate, which is caused by α inflation. To choose the appropriate test, we must maintain the balance between statistical power and type I error rate. If the test is too conservative, a type I error is not likely to occur. However, concurrently, the test may have insufficient power resulted in increased probability of type II error occurrence. Most researchers may hope to find the best way of adjusting the type I error rate to discriminate the real differences between observed data without wasting too much statistical power. It is expected that this paper will help researchers understand the differences between MCTs and apply them appropriately.},

When the content is controlled to be the same across experimental conditions, there has been little evidence that tutorial decisions have an impact on students’ learning. In this paper, we applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) to induce two sets of pedagogical policies from pre-existing human interaction data. The NormGain set was derived with the goal of enhancing tutorial decisions that contribute to learning while the InvNormGain set was derived with the goal of enhancing those decisions that contribute less or even nothing to learning. The two sets were then tested with human students. Our results show that when the content was controlled to be the same, different pedagogical policies did make a difference in learning and more speciﬁcally, the NormGain students outperformed their peers. Overall our results suggest that content exposure and practice opportunities can help students to learn even when tutors have poor pedagogical tutorial tactics. However, with effective tutorial tactics, students can learn even more.},

We developed production system models in ACT of how students solved problems in LISP, geometry, and algebra. Computer tutors were developed around these cognitive models. Construction of these tutors was guided by a set of eight principles loosely based on the ACT theory. Early evaluations of these tutors usually but not always showed significant achievement gains. Best case evaluations showed that students could achieve at least the same level of proficiency as conventional instruction in one-third of the time. Empirical studies showed that students were learning skills in production-rule units and that the best tutorial interaction style was one in which the tutor provides immediate feedback, consisting of short and directed error messages. The tutors appear to work better if they present themselves to students as non human tools to assist learning rather than as emulations of human tutors. Students working with these tutors display transfer to other environments to the degree that they can map the tutor environment into the test environment. These experiences have coalesced into a new system for developing and deploying tutors. This system involves first selecting a problem-solving interface, then constructing a curriculum under the guidance of a domain expert, then designing a cognitive model for solving problems in that environment, then building instruction around the productions in that model, and finally deploying the tutor in the classroom. New tutors are being built in this system to achieve the NCTM standards for high school mathematics in an urban setting.},

We also briefly present and compare various KR formalisms used (or that could be used) in ITSs as far as the specified KR requirements are concerned. It appears that various hybrid approaches to knowledge representation can satisfy the requirements in a greater degree than that of single representations. Another finding is that there is not a hybrid formalism that can satisfy the requirements of all of the modules of an ITS, but each one individually. So, a multi-paradigm representation environment could provide a solution to requirements satisfaction.},

	title = {Least-{Squares} {Policy} {Iteration}},
	abstract = {We propose a new approach to reinforcement learning for control problems which combines value-function approximation with linear architectures and approximate policy iteration. This new approach is motivated by the least-squares temporal-diﬀerence learning algorithm (LSTD) for prediction problems, which is known for its eﬃcient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal-diﬀerence algorithms. Heretofore, LSTD has not had a straightforward application to control problems mainly because LSTD learns the state value function of a ﬁxed policy which cannot be used for action selection and control without a model of the underlying process. Our new algorithm, least-squares policy iteration (LSPI), learns the state-action value function which allows for action selection without a model and for incremental policy improvement within a policy-iteration framework. LSPI is a model-free, oﬀ-policy method which can use eﬃciently (and reuse in each iteration) sample experiences collected in any manner. By separating the sample collection method, the choice of the linear approximation architecture, and the solution method, LSPI allows for focused attention on the distinct elements that contribute to practical reinforcement learning. LSPI is tested on the simple task of balancing an inverted pendulum and the harder task of balancing and riding a bicycle to a target location. In both cases, LSPI learns to control the pendulum or the bicycle by merely observing a relatively small number of trials where actions are selected randomly. LSPI is also compared against Q-learning (both with and without experience replay) using the same value function architecture. While LSPI achieves good performance fairly consistently on the diﬃcult bicycle task, Q-learning variants were rarely able to balance for more than a small fraction of the time needed to reach the target location.},

In the following paper, by use of a “real-life problem”, known to be non-trivial, and by a comparison with “classic” neural net training methods, I will try to show, that the modest success of applying genetic algorithms to the training of perceptrons, is caused not so much by the “multiple representations problem” as by the fact that problem-specific knowledge available is often ignored, thus making the problem unnecessarily tough for the genetic algorithm to solve. Special success is obtained by the use of a new fitness function, which takes into account the fact that the search performed by a genetic algorithm is holistic, and not local as is usually the case when perceptrons are trained by traditional methods.},

The domain knowledge should be represented in a more realistic way in order to allow the adaptive and/or personalized tutoring system to deliver the learning material to each individual learner dynamically taking into account her/his learning needs and her/his different learning pace. To succeed this, the domain knowledge representation has to depict the possible increase or decrease of the learner’s knowledge. Considering that the domain concepts that constitute the learning material are not independent from each other, the knowledge representation approach has to allow the system to recognize either the domain concepts that are already partly or completely known for a learner, or the domain concepts that s/he has forgotten, taking into account the learner’s knowledge level of the related concepts. In other words, the system should be informed about the knowledge dependencies that exist among the domain concepts of the learning material, as well as the strength on impact of each domain concept on others. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) seem to be an ideal way for representing graphically this kind of information. The suggested knowledge representation approach has been implemented in an e-learning adaptive system for teaching computer programming. The particular system was used by the students of a postgraduate program in the field of Informatics in the University of Piraeus and was compared with a corresponding system, in which the domain knowledge was represented using the most common used technique of network of concepts.

	abstract = {In this experimental study, an intelligent tutoring system called the fuzzy Bayesian intelligent tutoring system (FB-ITS), is developed by using artificial intelligence methods based on fuzzy logic and the Bayesian network technique to adaptively support students in learning environments. The effectiveness of the FB-ITS was evaluated by comparing it with two other versions of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), fuzzy ITS and Bayesian ITS, separately. Moreover, it was evaluated by comparing it with an existing traditional e-learning system. In order to evaluate whether the academic performance of the students in different learning groups differs or not, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used based on the students' pre-test and post-test scores. The study was conducted with 120 undergraduate university students. Results showed that students who studied using FB-ITS had significantly higher academic performance on average compared to other students who studied with the other systems. Regarding the time taken to perform the post-test, the results indicated that students who used the FB-ITS needed less time on average compared to students who used the traditional e-learning system. From the results, it could be concluded that the new system contributed in terms of the speed of performing the final exam and high academic success.},

This paper presents an application of GAs as a relevance feedback method aiming to improve the document representation and indexing. In this particular form of GAs, various document descriptions compete with each other and a better collection indexing is sought through reproduction, crossover and mutation operations. In this paradigm, we are searching for the optimal balance between two genetic parameters: the population size and the number of generations. We try to discover the optimal parameter choice both by experiments using the CACM and CISI collections, and by a theoretical analysis providing explanation of the experimental results. The general conclusion tends to be that larger populations have better chance of signiﬁcantly improving the eﬀectiveness of retrieval.},

	abstract = {Expert systems play a crucial role in the application of artificial intelligence to real problems. There are numerous methods of dealing with uncertainty in expert systems. Fuzzy logic is one such approach, in which the uncertainty is represented by possibility distributions for the antecedents and consequent of a rule. An uncertain input can be propagated to the consequent by a variety of mechanisms. This generality results in a higher computational burden for the system. More importantly, a means of controlling the response of the system to variations in input conditions is needed. In this paper, feedforward neural networks are proposed as a means of controlling this generality as well as providing the parallel computation necessary for fuzzy logic. It is demonstrated that these networks can learn and extrapolate complex relationships between antecedents and consequents for rules containing single and conjunctive antecedent clauses. Also, multiple compatible rules can be stored in a single network structure, increasing the efficiency of rule storage, and providing a natural mechanism for conflict resolution.},

	abstract = {Blast furnace (BF) is the main method of modern iron-making. Ensuring the stability of the BF conditions can effectively improve the quality and output of iron and steel. However, operations of BF depend on mainly human experience, which causes two problems: (1) human experience is not objective and is difficult to inherit and learn and (2) it is difficult to acquire knowledge that contains time information among multiple variables in BF. To address these problems, a data-driven method is proposed. In this article, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for discovering underlying knowledge in the form of temporal association rules (TARs) in BF iron-making data. First, a new TAR mining framework is proposed for mining temporal frequent patterns. Then, a novel TAR mining algorithm is proposed for mining underlying, up-to-date, and effective knowledge in the form of TARs. Finally, considering the updating of the BF database, a rule updating method is proposed that is based on the algorithm that is proposed in this article. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed algorithm in discovering TARs in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experiments on BF iron-making data have demonstrated the superior performance and practicability of the proposed method.},

The main strength is that only a small number of fuzzy rules may be needed to uniformly approximate continuous functions that have a complicated formulation but a relatively small number of extrema. The limitation is that in order to approximate frequently oscillatory continuous functions, the number of fuzzy rules must be large.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

In the description part, the core ideas of the WM method are used to develop three methods to extract fuzzy IF-THEN rules from data. The first method shows how to extract rules for the user-specified cases, the second method generates all the rules that can be generated directly from the data, and the third method extrapolates the rules generated by the second method over the entire domain of interest. In the prediction part, two fuzzy predictive models are constructed based on the fuzzy IF-THEN rules extracted by the methods of the description part. The first model gives a continuous output and is suitable for predicting continuous variables, and the second model gives a piecewise constant output and is suitable for predicting categorical variables. We show that by comparing the prediction accuracy of the fuzzy predictive models with different numbers of fuzzy sets covering the input variables, we can rank the importance of the input variables. We also propose an algorithm to optimize the fuzzy predictive models, and show how to use the models to solve pattern recognition problems. Throughout this paper, we use a set of real data from a steel rolling plant to demonstrate the ideas and test the models.},

Fuzzy descriptions of linguistic quantifiers and labels help to evaluate the degree to which an intensional answer describes a given set of tuples. Bounds on such descriptions can be defined in terms of a most general specification constituent description and a most specific generalization constraint description.

Fuzzy operations are provided and users can define complicated fuzzy calendars to discover the knowledge in the time intervals that are of interest to them. A border-based mining algorithm is proposed to find association rules incrementally. By keeping useful information of the database in a border, candidate itemsets can be computed in an efficient way. Updating of the discovered knowledge due to addition and deletion of transactions can also be done efficiently. The kept information can be used to help save the work of counting and unnecessary scans over the updated database can be avoided. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed system. A performance comparison with other systems is also given.},

The meta-parameters of the proposed approach are derived from data directly.

	abstract = {Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems have been widely applied for solving function approximation and regression-centric problems. Existing dynamic TSK models proposed in the literature can be broadly classified into two classes. Class I TSK models are essentially fuzzy systems that are limited to time-invariant environments. Class II TSK models are generally evolving systems that can learn in time-variant environments. This paper attempts to address the issues of achieving compact, up-to-date fuzzy rule bases and interpretable knowledge bases in TSK models. It proposes a novel rule pruning method which is simple, computationally efficient and biologically plausible. This rule pruning algorithm applies a gradual forgetting approach and adopts the Hebbian learning mechanism behind the long-term potentiation phenomenon in the brain. It also proposes a merging approach which is used to improve the interpretability of the knowledge bases. This approach can prevent derived fuzzy sets from expanding too many times to protect their semantic meanings. These two approaches are incorporated into a generic self-evolving Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy framework (GSETSK) which adopts an online data-driven incremental-learning-based approach. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed GSETSK against other established evolving TSK systems. GSETSK has also been tested on real world dataset using the high-way traffic flow density and Dow Jones index time series. The results are encouraging. GSETSK demonstrates its fast learning ability in time-variant environments. In addition, GSETSK derives an up-to-date and better interpretable fuzzy rule base while maintaining a high level of modeling accuracy at the same time.},

Therefore, we introduce a complete design procedure to learn and then optimize the system rule base, called the precise and fast fuzzy modeling approach. Under this paradigm, fuzzy rules are generated from numerical data using a parameterizable greedy-based learning method called selection-reduction, whose accuracy-speed efficiency is confirmed through empirical results and comparisons with reference methods. Qualitative justification for this method is provided based on the coaction between fuzzy logic and the intrinsic properties of greedy algorithms. To complete the precise and fast fuzzy modeling strategy, we finally present a rule-base optimization technique driven by a novel rule redundancy index, which takes into account the concepts of the distance between rules and the influence of a rule over the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed index can be used to obtain compact rule bases, which remain very accurate, thus increasing system interpretability.},

	abstract = {The performances of conventional crisp and fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithms trained using finite samples tends to be poor . With ldquoholesrdquo in the training data, it is unlikely that the decision area formed can actually represent the underlying data distribution. There is a need to capture more useful information from the limited training samples, therefore we propose a new fuzzy rule-based K-NN algorithm. A fuzzy rule-based initialization procedure differentiates our proposed algorithm from the conventional fuzzy K-NN algorithm. The new initialization procedure allows us to handle the imprecise inputs (neighborhood density and distance) through the natural framework of fuzzy logic system. Unlike conventional K-NN algorithms, the ability to fine tune the membership functions can lead to a highly versatile decision boundary. Thus, the new algorithm can be specifically tuned for different problems to achieve better results. The advantage is demonstrated on a synthetic data set in two-dimensional space. In addition, we also adopt weighted Euclidean distance measurement to overcome the curse of dimensionality . The Euclidean distance weights and the parameters of the fuzzy rule-based system are then optimized with genetic algorithm (GA) simultaneously. The practical applicability of the proposed algorithm is verified on four UCI data sets (Bupa liver disorders, Glass, Pima Indians diabetes and Wisconsin breast cancer) and Ford automotive data set with an improvement of 3.42\% in classification rate on average.},

	abstract = {I propose a novel general principle for unsupervised learning of distributed nonredundant internal representations of input patterns. The principle is based on two opposing forces. For each representational unit there is an adaptive predictor, which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages each unit to filter "abstract concepts" out of the environmental input such that these concepts are statistically independent of those on which the other units focus. I discuss various simple yet potentially powerful implementations of the principle that aim at finding binary factorial codes (Barlow et al. 1989), i.e., codes where the probability of the occurrence of a particular input is simply the product of the probabilities of the corresponding code symbols. Such codes are potentially relevant for (1) segmentation tasks, (2) speeding up supervised learning, and (3) novelty detection. Methods for finding factorial codes automatically implement Occam's razor for finding codes using a minimal number of units. Unlike previous methods the novel principle has a potential for removing not only linear but also nonlinear output redundancy. Illustrative experiments show that algorithms based on the principle of predictability minimization are practically feasible. The final part of this paper describes an entirely local algorithm that has a potential for learning unique representations of extended input sequences.},

This paper proposes a framework for designing two main parts of ITSs. Besides development framework, the second main reason for lack of significant advances in ITS development is its development cost. In general, this cost for instructional material is quite high and it becomes more in ITS development. The proposed method can significantly reduce the development cost. The cost reduction mainly is because of characteristics of applied mapping techniques. These maps are human readable and easily understandable by people who are not aware of knowledge representation techniques. The proposed framework is implemented for a graduate course at a technical university in Asia. This experiment provides an individualized instruction which is the main designing purpose of the ITSs.},

Both neural networks and fuzzy systems perform nonlinear mapping and both systems internally operate within a limited signal range between zero and one. Neural networks can handle basically an unlimited number of inputs and outputs while fuzzy systems have one output and number of inputs is practically limited to 2 or 3. The resulted nonlinear function produced by neural networks is smooth while functions produced by fuzzy systems are relatively rough. At the same time the design of fuzzy systems transparent and easy to follow while the development of neural networks is much more labor intensive. It is shows that most commonly used neural network architecture of MLP - Multi Layer Perceptron is also one of the least efficient ones. Also most commonly used EBP - Error Back Propagation algorithm is not only very slow, but also it is not able to find solutions for optimal neural network architectures. EBP can solve problems only when large number of neurons is used, but this way neural network loses its generalization property. Performances of both fuzzy systems and neural networks are compared leading to the conclusion that neural networks can produce much more accurate nonlinear mapping and they may require less hardware.},

This paper proposes a neuro-fuzzy-based, self-organizing skill-learning framework, which differs from previous work in its capability of decomposing a skill by self-categorizing it into significant stimulus-response units (SRU, a fundamental unit of our skill representation), and self-organizing learned skills into a new skill. The proposed neuro-fuzzy-based, self-organizing skill-learning framework can be realized by skill decomposition and skill synthesis. Skill decomposition aims at representing a skill and acquiring it by SRUs, and is implemented by stages with a five-layer neuro-fuzzy network with supervised learning, resolution control, and reinforcement learning to enable robots to identify a sufficient number of significant SRUs for accomplishing a given task without extraneous actions. Skill synthesis aims at organizing a new skill by sequentially planning learned skills composed of SRUs, and is realized by stages, which establish common SRUs between two similar skills and self-organize a new skill from these common SRUs and additional new SRUs by reinforcement learning. Computer simulations and experiments with a Pioneer 3-DX mobile robot were conducted to validate the self-organizing capability of the proposed skill-learning framework in identifying significant SRUs from task examples and in common SRUs between similar skills and learning new skills from learned skills.},

	abstract = {A recurrent self-organizing neural fuzzy inference network (RSONFIN) is proposed. The RSONFIN is inherently a recurrent multilayered connectionist network for realizing the basic elements and functions of dynamic fuzzy inference, and may be considered to be constructed from a series of dynamic fuzzy rules. The temporal relations embedded in the network are built by adding some feedback connections representing the memory elements to a feedforward neural fuzzy network. Each weight as well as node in the RSONFIN has its own meaning and represents a special element in a fuzzy rule. There are no hidden nodes initially in the RSONFIN. They are created online via concurrent structure identification and parameter identification. The structure learning together with the parameter learning forms a fast learning algorithm for building a small, yet powerful, dynamic neural fuzzy network. Two major characteristics of the RSONFIN can thus be seen: 1) the recurrent property of the RSONFIN makes it suitable for dealing with temporal problems and 2) no predetermination, like the number of hidden nodes, must be given, since the RSONFIN can find its optimal structure and parameters automatically and quickly. Moreover, to reduce the number of fuzzy rules generated, a flexible input partition method, the aligned clustering-based algorithm, is proposed. Various simulations on temporal problems are done and performance comparisons with some existing recurrent networks are also made. Efficiency of the RSONFIN is verified from these results},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new on-line algorithm for creating a self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN) from sample patterns to implement a singleton or Takagi-Sugeno (TS) type fuzzy model. The SOFNN is based on ellipsoidal basis function (EBF) neurons consisting of a center vector and a width vector. New methods of the structure learning and the parameter learning, based on new adding and pruning techniques and a recursive on-line learning algorithm, are proposed and developed. A proof of the convergence of both the estimation error and the linear network parameters is also given in the paper. The proposed methods are very simple and effective and generate a fuzzy neural model with a high accuracy and compact structure. Simulation work shows that the SOFNN has the capability of self-organization to determine the structure and parameters of the network automatically.},

In this paper, we propose hesitant fuzzy sets. Although from a formal point of view, they can be seen as fuzzy multisets, we will show that their interpretation differs from the two existing approaches for fuzzy multisets. Because of this, together with their definition, we also introduce some basic operations. In addition, we also study their relationship with intuitionistic fuzzy sets. We prove that the envelope of the hesitant fuzzy sets is an intuitionistic fuzzy set. We prove also that the operations we propose are consistent with the ones of intuitionistic fuzzy sets when applied to the envelope of the hesitant fuzzy sets. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new form of describing fuzzy sets (FSs) and a new form of fuzzy rule-based (FRB) systems, namely, empirical fuzzy sets (εFSs) and empirical fuzzy rule-based (εFRB) systems. Traditionally, the membership functions (MFs), which are the key mathematical representation of FSs, are designed subjectively or extracted from the data by clustering projections or defined subjectively. εFSs, on the contrary, are described by the empirically derived membership functions (εMFs). The new proposal made in this paper is based on the recently introduced Empirical Data Analytics (EDA) computational framework and is closely linked with the density of the data. This allows to keep and improve the link between the objective data and the subjective labels, linguistic terms, and classes definition. Furthermore, εFSs can deal with heterogeneous data combining categorical with continuous and/or discrete data in a natural way. εFRB systems can be extracted from data including data streams and can have dynamically evolving structure. However, they can also be used as a tool to represent expert knowledge. The main difference from the traditional FSs and FRB systems is that the expert does not need to define the MF per variable; instead, possibly multimodal, densities will be extracted automatically from the data and used as εMFs in a vector form for all numerical variables. This is done in a seamless way whereby the human involvement is only required to label the classes and linguistic terms. Moreover, even this intervention is optional. Thus, the proposed new approach to define and design the FSs and FRB systems puts the human “in the driving seat.” Instead of asking experts to define features and MFs correspondingly, to parameterize them, to define algorithm parameters, to choose types of MFs, or to label each individual item, it only requires (optionally) to select prototypes from data and (again, optionally) to label them. Numerical examples as well as a naïve empirical fuzzy (εF) classifier are presented with an illustrative purpose. Due to the very fundamental nature of the proposal, it can have a very wide area of applications resulting in a series of new algorithms such as εF classifiers, εF predictors, εF controllers, and so on. This is left for the future research.},

In this work, we investigate the language generation power of WSN P systems, where the set of spike trains of halting computations of a given WSN P system constitutes the language generated by that system. Several relationships of the families of languages generated by WSN P systems with the family of finite languages and the family of regular languages are obtained. The family of recursively enumerable languages is characterized by projections of inverse-morphic images of languages generated by WSN P systems.},

In this paper, we attempt to use the data mining technique to analyze time series. Many previous studies on data mining have focused on handling binary-valued data. Time series data, however, are usually quantitative values. We thus extend our previous fuzzy mining approach for handling time-series data to find linguistic association rules. The proposed approach first uses a sliding window to generate continues subsequences from a given time series and then analyzes the fuzzy itemsets from these subsequences. Appropriate post-processing is then performed to remove redundant patterns. Experiments are also made to show the performance of the proposed mining algorithm. Since the final results are represented by linguistic rules, they will be friendlier to human than quantitative representation.},
